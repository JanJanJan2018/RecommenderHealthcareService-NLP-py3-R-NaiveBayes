"Chiropractic adjustments and treatments serve the needs of millions of people around the world.

 

Adjustments offer effective, non-invasive and cost-effective solutions to neck and back pain, as well as a myriad of other medical issues.

Have you ever stopped to wonder how many of us suffer from neck and back stiffness or pain?

Apart from the obvious discomfort, simple daily tasks such as driving a car, crossing a busy street and picking things up from the floor can become all too challenging for individuals experiencing such pain.

As anyone who has experienced pain would know, having restricted movement can be debilitating and unfortunately, our busy world doesn?t allow for us to stop.

 
Some of the benefits of long-term chiropractic care include:

    Chiropractors can identify mechanical issues that cause spine-related pain and offer a series of adjustments that provide near immediate relief. Following appointments, patients often report feeling their symptoms noticeably better.
    When a chiropractor performs an adjustment, they can help restore movement in joints that have ?locked up?. This becomes possible as treatment allows muscles surrounding joints to relax, thereby reducing joint stiffness.
    Many factors affect health, including exercise patterns, nutrition, sleep, heredity and the environment in which we live. Rather than just treat symptoms of the disease, chiropractic care focuses on a holistic approach to naturally maintain health and resist disease.
    Chiropractic adjustments help restore normal function and movement to the entire body. Many patients report an improvement in their ability to move with efficiency and strength.
    Many patients find delight in the results chiropractic adjustments have on old and chronic injuries. Whether an injury is, in fact, new or old, chiropractic care can help reduce pain, restore mobility and provide quick pain relief to all joints in the body. Such care can help maintain better overall health and thus faster recovery time.

Have you ever noticed that when you are in pain and unable to perform regular or favorite activities, it can put a strain on emotional and mental well-being?

For example, the increased stress from not being able to properly perform a paid job. This, in turn, can have a negative impact on physical health with increases in heart rate and blood pressure. The domino effect often continues with sleep becoming disturbed, with resulting lethargy and tiredness during the day. Does anyone really feel up to exercising in this state?

Chiropractic care is a natural method of healing the body?s communication system and never relies on the use of pharmaceutical drugs or invasive surgery.

Doctors of Chiropractic work collaboratively with other healthcare professionals. Should your condition require the attention of another healthcare profession, that recommendation or referral will be made.

October 29, 2019 - UnitedHealthcare (UHC) is combatting the opioid epidemic and high healthcare costs with new physical therapy and chiropractic care benefits to prevent, delay, or in some cases substitute for invasive spinal procedures.

?With millions of Americans experiencing low back pain currently or at some point during their lifetimes, we believe this benefit design will help make a meaningful difference by improving health outcomes while reducing costs,? said Anne Docimo, MD, UnitedHealthcare chief medical officer.

Lower back pain is in part responsible for sustaining the opioid epidemic and also increases healthcare costs.

    How Major Payers Provide Substance Abuse Care for Opioid Misuse
    Opioid Overdoses Fall by 2% from 2017 to 2018, CDC Reports
    Physical Therapy, Chiropractic Back Care Cut Opioid Use, Costs

Although opioid overdoses fell by two percent from 2017 to 2018 and a legal battles aim to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable, there is no end in sight for the opioid epidemic. Industry professionals are still grappling with the balance between cutting opioid prescriptions will working to reduce patient pain.

Common conditions such as low back pain bolster the epidemic?s presence, with clinicians still prescribing the opioids against best practice recommendations. According to a recent OptumLabs study, 9 percent of patients with newly diagnosed low back pain are prescribed opioids and lower back pain currently contributes 52 percent to the overall opioid prescription rate.

In addition to boosting opioids distribution, alternative, invasive lower back pain treatments can significantly impact healthcare spending.

It is not new information that physical therapy and chiropractic care are effective, lower cost alternatives to spinal imaging or surgery. However, payers are still in the process of adopting the method.

To counteract the high-cost, high-risk potential of using opioids to treat back pain, UHC created a benefit that does not rely on medication or technology but rather on physical therapy and chiropractic care.

The benefit allows eligible employers to offer physical therapist and chiropractor visits with no out-of-pocket costs. Members who already receive physical therapist and chiropractic care benefits under UHC?s employer-sponsored health plans and who have maxed out their visits will not receive additional visits under this benefit.

However, for those who still have visits to use and who choose physical therapy or chiropractic care over other forms of treatment, the copay or deductible for those visits will be waived and they will receive three visits at no cost.

UHC has high expectations for the fiscal and physical impacts of this benefit.

According to UHC?s analysis, the health payer expects that by 2021, opioid use will decrease by 19 percent. Spinal imaging test frequency and spinal surgeries will be reduced by 22 percent and 21 percent, respectively. In addition to these specific goals, UHC hopes to see a decrease in the overall cost of spinal care.

The same OptumLabs study demonstrated that UHC?s expectations are not without precedent.

The study looked at the correlation between out-of-pocket costs and patient utilization of noninvasive treatments. Researchers discovered that members whose copay was over $30 were a little under 30 percent less likely to choose physical therapy as opposed to more invasive treatments.

An American Journal of Managed Care study in June 2019 found that patients with high deductibles, typically over $1,000, were less likely to visit physical therapy.

Eligible employers may be brand new or renewing their membership. They must be fully insured and over 51 or more employees strong. The benefit is currently available in Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, New York, and North Carolina.

However, UHC plans to expand the benefit from 2020 into 2021. By the end of this expansion period, the benefit will also be available to self-funded employers and organizations with an employee population between 2 and 50. The benefit will span ten states, primarily in the southeast.

?This new benefit design may help encourage people with low back pain to get the right care at the right time and in the right setting, helping expand access to evidence-based and more affordable treatments,? said Docimo.","https://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/unitedhealthcare-combats-opioid-crisis-with-non-opioid-benefits","chiropractic benefits",NA,NA,NA

    Chiropractic Adjustment
    What Research Shows
    Safety

Chiropractic adjustment, also called spinal manipulation, is a procedure done by a chiropractor using the hands or small instruments to apply controlled force to a spinal joint. The goal is to improve spinal motion and physical function of the entire body. Chiropractic adjustment is safe when performed by someone who is properly trained and licensed to practice chiropractic care. Complications are rare, but they are possible. Learn more about both the benefits and risks.
Chiropractic adjustment
Verywell / Brianna Gilmartin 
Chiropractic Adjustment

One of the most important reasons people seek chiropractic care is because it is a completely drug-free therapy. Someone dealing with joint pain, back pain, or headaches might consider visiting a chiropractor.

The goal of chiropractic adjustment is to place the body into a proper position so the body can heal itself. Treatments are believed to reduce stress on the immune system, reducing the potential for disease. Chiropractic care aims to address the entire body, including a person?s ability to move, perform, and even think.
What Research Shows

Many people wonder how helpful chiropractic care is in treating years of trauma and poor posture. There have been numerous studies showing the therapeutic benefits of chiropractic care.
Sciatica

Sciatica is a type of pain affecting the sciatic nerve, the large nerve extending from the low back down the back of the legs. Other natural therapies don?t always offer relief and most people want to avoid steroid injections and surgery, so they turn to chiropractic care.

A double-blind trial reported in the Spine Journal compared active and simulated chiropractic manipulations in people with sciatic nerve pain. Active manipulations involved the patient laying down and receiving treatment from a chiropractor. Stimulated manipulations involved electrical muscle stimulation with electrodes placed on the skin to send electrical pulses to different parts of the body.

The researchers determined active manipulation offered more benefits than stimulated. The people who received active manipulations experienced fewer days of moderate or severe pain and other sciatica symptoms. They also reported no adverse effects.
Neck Pain

One study reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine looked at different therapies for treating neck pain. They divided 272 study participants into three groups: one that received spinal manipulation from a chiropractic doctor, a second group given over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers, narcotics, and muscle relaxers, and a third group who did at-home exercises. 

After 12 weeks, patients reported a 75% pain reduction, with the chiropractic treatment group achieving the most improvement. About 57% of the chiropractic group achieved pain reduction, while 48% received pain reduction from exercising, and 33% from medication.

After one year, 53% of the drug-free groups continued to report pain relief compared to only 38% of those taking pain medications. 
Headaches

Cervicogenic headaches and migraines are commonly treated by chiropractors. Cervicogenic headaches are often called secondary headaches because pain is usually referred from another source, usually the neck. Migraine headaches cause severe, throbbing pain and are generally experienced on one side of the head. There are few non-medicinal options for managing both types of chronic headaches.

Research reported in the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics suggests chiropractic care, specifically spinal manipulation, can improve migraines and cervicogenic headaches.  
Frozen Shoulder

Frozen shoulder affects the shoulder joint and involves pain and stiffness that develops gradually and gets worse. Frozen shoulder can be quite painful, and treatment involves preserving as much range of motion in the shoulder as possible and managing pain.

A clinical trial reported in the Journal of Chiropractic Medicine described how patients suffering from frozen shoulder responded to chiropractic treatment. Of the 50 patients, 16 completely recovered, 25 showed a 75 to 90% improvement, and eight showed a 50 to 75% improvement. Only one person showed zero to 50% improvement. The researchers concluded most people can get improvement by treating frozen shoulder with chiropractic treatment.
Preventing Need for Surgery

Chiropractic care may reduce the need for back surgery. Guidelines reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggest that it's reasonable for people suffering from back pain to try spinal manipulation before deciding on surgical intervention.
Low Back Pain

Studies have shown chiropractic care, including spinal manipulation, can provide relief from mild to moderate low back pain. In fact, spinal manipulation may work as well as other standard treatments, including pain-relief medications.

A 2011 review of 26 clinical trials looked at the effectiveness of different treatments for chronic low back pain. What they found was that spinal manipulation is just as effective as other treatments for reducing back pain and improving function.
Safety


When chiropractors are correctly trained and licensed, chiropractic care is safe. Mild side effects are to be expected and include temporary soreness, stiffness, and tenderness in the treated area. However, you still want to do your research. Ask for a referral from your doctor. Look at the chiropractor?s website, including patient reviews. Meet with the chiropractor to discuss his or her treatment practices and ask about possible adverse effects related to treatment.

If you decide a chiropractor isn?t for you, consider seeing an osteopathic doctor. Osteopaths are fully licensed doctors who can practice all areas of medicine. They have received special training on the musculoskeletal system, which includes manual readjustments, myofascial release and other physical manipulation of bones and muscle tissues.","https://www.verywellhealth.com/is-chiropractic-adjustment-safe-4588279","chiropractic benefits",NA,NA,"Risks and side effects associated with chiropractic adjustments may include:

    temporary headaches
    fatigue after treatment
    discomfort in parts of the body that were treated

Rare but serious risks associated with chiropractic adjustment include:

    stroke
    cauda equina syndrome, a condition involving pinched nerves in the lower part of the spinal canal
    worsening of herniated disks (although research isn't conclusive)

In addition to effectiveness, research has focused on the safety of chiropractic treatments, mainly spinal manipulation. 

One 2017 review of 250 articles looked at serious adverse events and benign events associated with chiropractic care. Based on the evidence the researchers reviewed, serious adverse events accounted for one out of every two million spinal manipulations to 13 per 10,00 patients. Serious adverse events included spinal or neurological problems and cervical arterial strokes (dissection of any of the arteries in the neck).

Benign events were more common and included more pain and higher levels of neck problems, but most were short-term problems.

The researchers confirmed serious adverse events were rare and often related to other preexisting conditions, while benign events are more common. However, the reasons for any types of adverse events are unknown.

A second 2017 review looked 118 articles and found frequently described adverse events include stroke, headache and vertebral artery dissection (cervical arterial stroke). Forty-six percent of the reviews determined that spinal manipulation was safe, while 13% expressed concern of harm. The remaining studies were unclear or neutral. While the researchers did not offer an overall conclusion, they determined spinal manipulation can significantly be helpful, and some risk does exist.

"Advanced Chiropractic Relief: 8 Key Benefits of Chiropractor Care

Are you one of the 50 million Americans who suffer from chronic pain? If so you?re probably intimately familiar with the feeling of pure desperation that can arise from an inability to find relief.

In addition to physical issues, chronic pain can cause anxiety, depression, and more. However, there could be a light at the end of the tunnel. Many people are finding advanced chiropractic relief that is completely changing their lives.

Your body is a world in itself. At this very moment, more than a million chemical reactions are taking place in your body. It manufactures energy, it regulates your heartbeat, your breathing and it regenerates and heals itself. Everything takes place without your conscious knowledge, without you controlling it voluntarily. The master system that controls it all is your nervous system.

The nervous system is made out of your brain, spinal cord and all your nerves.

The energy that flows through your nervous system in your body is like electricity. In order to have that electric flow normally and freely, we need to have a well functioning spine. Whenever you have disruption of that flow, disease happens. That would be the case when your spine is misaligned or is not moving properly.

Did you know that 90% of stimulation and nutrition to the brain is generated by the movement of the spine?

The more mechanically distorted a person is, the less energy is available for thinking, metabolism and healing.

This is why it is so important to have a healthy spine, a proper posture, to exercise, to eat properly ? all of it truly matters for your quality of life.
Chiropractors localize the areas of your spine that do not move properly ? referred to as vertebral subluxations ? and adjust them with a specific high speed, but yet gentle, thrust to improve spinal motion.

Want to learn about some of the ways chiropractic care can help you? Keep reading for insight into some of the key benefits of seeing a chiropractor.

The benefits of chiropractic care are numerous:

1. Lower Blood Pressure

Studies show that chiropractic treatment can lower your blood pressure. Sometimes, this works just as well as a prescription blood pressure medication! This benefit can also last for as long as six months after treatment.

High blood pressure can cause an array of serious side effects like nausea, fatigue, dizziness, and anxiety. Sufferers who haven?t found relief should consider consulting with a chiropractor. A chiropractic adjustment may be the solution.

Some studies have shown that chiropractic adjustments can also help patients who are suffering from low blood pressure.

2. Reduced Inflammation

In many cases, joint issues, pain, and tension are caused by inflammation in the body. Chiropractic adjustments can reduce inflammation.

This leads to relief of muscle tension, chronic back pain, and joint pain. These adjustments can sometimes also slow the progression of inflammation-related diseases, like arthritis.

3. Better Sleep

Patients who receive chiropractic adjustments report a significant improvement in their sleep patterns. If you regularly suffer from insomnia, visiting a chiropractor regularly may help. Also, when you experience pain relief, this will help you get a restful night?s sleep.

4. Digestive Relief

Chiropractors often give nutritional advice as part of their services. However, this isn?t the only way that they provide patients with digestive relief.

Adjusting the thoraco-lumbar spine restores the neurological function of your digestive system. Regular adjustments can help with chronic digestive issues.

5. Stress Release

Everyday life can cause muscle cramping, inflammation, and more. When you?re sore from working at a computer, heavy lifting, or just dealing with emotional stress, a chiropractic adjustment can help. This leads to greater comfort and advanced pain relief.

6. Improvement of Neurological Conditions

A chiropractic adjustment can also increase blood flow to the brain and increase the flow of cerebral spinal fluid. This means that patients suffering from neurological conditions like epilepsy and multiple sclerosis can significantly benefit from regular adjustments.

This is a relatively new area of study, but the potential is huge. Those suffering from these conditions will want to do some research. It?s important to find the best chiropractor in their area with experience dealing with these specific types of cases.

7. Chiropractic care can improve communication from your brain to your muscles

Research seems to show that chiropractic care can improve your brain-body communication, helping your brain to be more aware of what is going on in the body so it can control your body better.

Better health, more energy and vitality are some of the positive effects of getting your spine adjusted. It sets your vertebrae back into motion freeing up the energy that travels through your nerves.

Chiropractic care is a partnership. The results patients want is a combination of what the chiropractor does and what the patient does.

There are many good things that can be changed and improved for a better lifestyle: exercise, good nutrition, good mental attitude and spinal adjustments.

Your whole body will work better by having your nervous system free of interference. That is the essence of chiropractic care and is designed for you and your family.

8. Pain Relief

Perhaps the most well-known benefit of going to a chiropractor is pain relief. Adjustments can help with a huge array of painful conditions including the following.

Neck and Lower Back Pain

Adjustments are the most effective non-invasive pain relief method for this type of pain. They may help patients avoid having to take prescription pain management drugs.

Sciatica

Treatments help relieve pressure on the nerve. This results in less severe pain that lasts for a fewer number of days.

Headaches

Chiropractic adjustments help headaches and migraines. They do this by treating back misalignment, muscle tension, and stress. Cervical spine manipulation was associated with significant improvement in headache outcomes in trials involving patients with neck pain and/or neck dysfunction and headache.

Chronic headaches can result from the abnormal positioning of the head and can be worsened from neck pressure and movement. Chiropractic removes the interference whether it may be from the distant muscle tightness in the back causing strain on your spine or an abnormal lordotic cervical curve and moving vertebrae.
Chiropractic care can reduce the duration of headaches, lower their intensity when they do occur and limit the frequency of their occurrence all together.

Menstrual cramps

Chiropractic treatment removes tension from the pelvis and sacrum. It also regulates the neurological function communicating with the reproductive organs. Adjustments can also relieve the bloating, cramping, and pain associated with menstrual cramps

Anyone who has tried traditional medical treatments and has been unable to find pain relief should experiment with chiropractic care. More often than not, you?ll be pleasantly surprised!

Bonus: Advanced Chiropractic Relief

In addition to the benefits listed above, adjustments can bring advanced chiropractic relief for a wide variety of other conditions as well as overall life improvement. A few examples include:

Scoliosis ? adjustments have shown to help with the pain, reduced range of motion, abnormal posture, and even difficulty breathing caused by this abnormal curvature of the spine

Vertigo ? an adjustment can help realign and balance the spine, thereby reducing the dizziness, nausea, and disorientation caused by vertigo

Sinus and allergy relief ? adjusting the upper cervical spine can help drain the sinuses and provide immediate and lasting relief from both long-term and seasonal allergies

Expectant mothers ? women can experience relief from pain and morning sickness and are better able to maintain proper posture during and after pregnancy

Children?s issues ? treatments have been shown to help children with acid reflux, cholic, and ear infections
Athletic performance ? the reduction in pain and inflammation is particularly beneficial for professional and amateur athletes

Stimulates the immune system ? chiropractic care helps to boost the immune system, speeding up the healing process following illnesses or injuries. One of the most important studies showing the positive effect chiropractic care can have on the immune system and general health was performed by Ronald Pero, Ph.D., chief of cancer prevention research at New York?s Preventive Medicine Institute and professor of medicine at New York University. Dr. Pero measured the immune systems of people under chiropractic care as compared to those in the general population and those with cancer and other serious diseases.

In his initial three-year study of 107 individuals who had been under chiropractic care for five years or more, the chiropractic patients were found to have a 200% greater immune competence than people who had not received chiropractic care, and 400% greater immune competence than people with cancer and other serious diseases. The immune system superiority of those under chiropractic care did not diminish with age.

Dr. Pero stated: ?When applied in a clinical framework, I have never seen a group other than this chiropractic group to experience a 200% increase over the normal patients. This is why it is so dramatically important. We have never seen such a positive improvement in a group.?

As you can see, there are almost limitless benefits to seeking chiropractic treatment. If you haven?t tried it yet, what are you waiting for?

There?s no need to accept pain and discomfort as a normal part of life. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain, so it only makes sense to find out more about this possibly life-changing approach to improving your health and wellness.","https://hafkeychiropractic.com/advanced-chiropractic-relief-8-key-benefits-of-chiropractor-care/","chiropractic benefits",NA,NA,NA

"Massage: Get in touch with its many benefits

Massage can be a powerful tool to help you take charge of your health and well-being. See if it's right for you.
By Mayo Clinic Staff

Massage is no longer available only through luxury spas and upscale health clubs. Today, massage therapy is offered in businesses, clinics, hospitals and even airports. If you've never tried massage, learn about its possible health benefits and what to expect during a massage therapy session.
What is massage?

Massage is a general term for pressing, rubbing and manipulating your skin, muscles, tendons and ligaments. Massage may range from light stroking to deep pressure. There are many different types of massage, including these common types:

    Swedish massage. This is a gentle form of massage that uses long strokes, kneading, deep circular movements, vibration and tapping to help relax and energize you.
    Deep massage. This massage technique uses slower, more-forceful strokes to target the deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue, commonly to help with muscle damage from injuries.
    Sports massage. This is similar to Swedish massage, but it's geared toward people involved in sport activities to help prevent or treat injuries.
    Trigger point massage. This massage focuses on areas of tight muscle fibers that can form in your muscles after injuries or overuse.

Benefits of massage

Massage is generally considered part of complementary and integrative medicine. It's increasingly being offered along with standard treatment for a wide range of medical conditions and situations.

Studies of the benefits of massage demonstrate that it is an effective treatment for reducing stress, pain and muscle tension.

While more research is needed to confirm the benefits of massage, some studies have found massage may also be helpful for:

    Anxiety
    Digestive disorders
    Fibromyalgia
    Headaches
    Insomnia related to stress
    Myofascial pain syndrome
    Soft tissue strains or injuries
    Sports injuries
    Temporomandibular joint pain

Beyond the benefits for specific conditions or diseases, some people enjoy massage because it often produces feelings of caring, comfort and connection.

Despite its benefits, massage isn't meant as a replacement for regular medical care. Let your doctor know you're trying massage and be sure to follow any standard treatment plans you have.
Risks of massage



Some forms of massage can leave you feeling a bit sore the next day. But massage shouldn't ordinarily be painful or uncomfortable. If any part of your massage doesn't feel right or is painful, speak up right away. Most serious problems come from too much pressure during massage.
What you can expect during a massage

You don't need any special preparation for massage. Before a massage therapy session starts, your massage therapist should ask you about any symptoms, your medical history and what you're hoping to get out of massage. Your massage therapist should explain the kind of massage and techniques he or she will use.

In a typical massage therapy session, you undress or wear loose-fitting clothing. Undress only to the point that you're comfortable. You generally lie on a table and cover yourself with a sheet. You can also have a massage while sitting in a chair, fully clothed. Your massage therapist should perform an evaluation through touch to locate painful or tense areas and to determine how much pressure to apply.

Depending on preference, your massage therapist may use oil or lotion to reduce friction on your skin. Tell your massage therapist if you might be allergic to any ingredients.

A massage session may last from 10 to 90 minutes, depending on the type of massage and how much time you have. No matter what kind of massage you choose, you should feel calm and relaxed during and after your massage.

If a massage therapist is pushing too hard, ask for lighter pressure. Occasionally you may have a sensitive spot in a muscle that feels like a knot. It's likely to be uncomfortable while your massage therapist works it out. But if it becomes painful, speak up.
Finding a massage therapist

Ask your doctor or someone else you trust for a recommendation. Most states regulate massage therapists through licensing, registration or certification requirements.

Don't be afraid to ask a potential massage therapist such questions as:

    Are you licensed, certified or registered?
    What is your training and experience?
    How many massage therapy sessions do you think I'll need?
    What's the cost, and is it covered by health insurance?

The take-home message about massage

Brush aside any thoughts that massage is only a feel-good way to indulge or pamper yourself. To the contrary, massage can be a powerful tool to help you take charge of your health and well-being, whether you have a specific health condition or are just looking for another stress reliever. You can even learn how to do self-massage or how to engage in massage with a partner at home.

"7 Benefits of Massage Therapy

Massage therapy is a treatment approach which is growing in demand and popularity. It was once considered an alternative or fringe approach, but it is now becoming much more mainstream. More importantly, now that massage therapy is considered a mainstream treatment option, many insurance companies provide coverage for treatment sessions. This form of therapy involves hands-on techniques to increase circulation, relieve tension, reduce stress, relieve anxiety, improve sleep, and promote relaxation throughout the entire body, as well as many other benefits. The body?s soft tissue areas include the muscles, tendons, connective tissue, etc. If someone is tense and in need of a release, or they have been injured and have extensive muscle and/or nerve tissue damage that plagues their body, massage therapy might be worth exploring. Here are some benefits of massage therapy.

1. It Is Relaxing ? When the body is tense and under stress, it produces unhealthy levels of the well-known stress hormone, cortisol, which can contribute to weight gain, sleeplessness, digestive problems, and headaches. Massage therapy has been shown to decrease cortisol levels in the body. This enables the body to enter a recovery mode. Moreover, this form of therapy also triggers lasting feelings of relaxation, improved mood, and reduced stress levels.

2. It Reduces Stress ? Not only can massage therapy help with stress relief, but regular massage sessions over a prolonged period of time can boost energy levels, reduce pain, and stimulate individuals on physical as well as emotional levels.

3. It Can Help Lower Blood Pressure ? Regular massage therapy sessions have been found to reduce blood pressure levels. In fact, some long-term studies have shown that a consistent massage program can reduce both systolic (upper number) and diastolic (lower number) blood pressure. Moreover, it can also reduce cortisol levels within the body. Furthermore, consistent massage sessions can also reduce trigger sources for anxiety, hostility, tension, and depression. In turn, lower blood pressure levels can also reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and/or kidney failure, as well as many other health issues.

4. It Promotes Muscle Relaxation ? The purpose of massage therapy is to target the source of the body?s pain via eliminating tense muscles, increasing flexibility, and providing relaxation to the affected muscles as well as the body as a whole. Massage also promotes circulation to the affected or injured muscles, which increases nutrients and oxygen to the damaged tissues. In turn, this increased activity to the affected sites reduces stiffness and edema (swelling) in the muscles and joints, as well as increases flexibility to help reduce pain. Moreover, this form of therapy also releases endorphins (pain-killing hormones), which boost the dopamine and serotonin levels in the body. These hormones assist the body in many ways?physically as well as emotionally. Case in point, they promote healing, pain management, and feelings of euphoria, as well as help to calm the nerves.

5. It Can Help Improve Circulation ? The long-term benefits of massage therapy are not to be underestimated. Improved circulation is part of a snowball effect that occurs in the body as a result of receiving regular massage therapy on a consistent basis. This is because proper circulation brings damaged, stiff, and tense muscles the rich blood supply they need to promote healing.

Moreover, massage also promotes improved circulation via the use of hands-on pressure, which moves the blood through the damaged and congested areas of the body. In turn, the release of this same pressure causes new blood to flow into tissues. Furthermore, the squeezing, twisting, and pulling action of the massage technique also removes lactic acid from the muscle tissues. As a result, this action improves the lymph fluid circulation, which carries metabolic waste products away from internal organs and muscles. In turn, this results in lower blood pressure levels and improved overall body function.

6. It Can Help Improve Posture ? Many Americans experience back, neck, and muscle pain from a variety of sources. However, the primary cause of this pain results from poor posture. In fact, chronic back pain, which is the number one reason for missed work days and second most common cause of disability, is often the result of incorrect or poor posture while standing and/or sitting. Moreover, being overweight, poor posture, and repetitive or overuse movements can also contribute to the strain on the back and other potential problem areas. As a result, the added strain often causes spasms, pain, and tense muscles in the hips, glutes, back, neck, and legs.

Massage therapy can help get the body back into proper alignment. In fact, improving one?s posture can be one of the most beneficial and relaxing aspects of massage therapy. Massage allows the body to relax and loosen the muscles made tense and sore via bad posture. In turn, this allows the body to position itself in its organic and pain-free posture. As part of a consistent massage therapy program, the body?s muscles are loosened and relaxed. Moreover, the joints have greater freedom, flexibility, range of motion, and pressure points are relieved. As a result, the body is able to position itself in an organic and healthy posture. In short, massage therapy helps to correct the positions and movements developed over time as a reaction to pain.

7. It Can Help Strengthen the Body?s Immune System ? Regular massage sessions provide many benefits to the human body. It is a well-known fact that individuals who experience high levels of stress are more vulnerable to illness and injury. When stress is combined with sleep disturbances and poor nutrition, the impact is directed at the body?s immune system. Its ability to naturally protect itself against infections, pathogens, and bacteria is greatly reduced. Some might wonder how massage therapy benefits the immune system. Studies have indicated that regular massage sessions not only help reduce stress, but can also boost the immune system?s cytotoxic capacity (activity level of the body?s natural ?killer cells?) and enhances the body?s ability to deliver nourishment. Moreover, massage therapy can be a great addition to any exercise program. Much like regular exercise can keep the body fine-tuned, regular massage therapy can help keep the immune system strong and resilient.

Once considered an alternative or fringe approach, massage therapy is now much more mainstream and growing in popularity. More importantly, now that massage therapy is considered a mainstream treatment option, many insurance companies provide coverage for treatment sessions. This form of therapy involves hands-on techniques to increase circulation, relieve tension, reduce stress, relieve anxiety, improve sleep, and promote relaxation throughout the entire body, as well as many other benefits.","http://www.body-mindmassage.com/7-benefits-of-massage-therapy/","massage benefits","google",NA,NA

You know that post-massage feeling. Your mind is clear and your body is relaxed. An occasional massage leaves you feeling great, but regular massage can do so much more.

6 Healthy Ways Getting a Massage Benefits Your Entire Body

Massage therapy may help boost focus, relieve anxiety, and even improve sleep.
By Brielle Gregory

When it comes to relaxation, there are a few things we all associate with that it: spa days, cozying up by the fire, staying in bed until 2 p.m. and, of course, getting a massage. And although massage is great for helping you relax, it has more therapeutic benefits, too.

The term ?massage? itself actually encompasses a wide array of different types of massage, ranging from Swedish massage (the most common type), to massages that have a more targeted and specific purpose, like a sports massage, which is aimed at helping athletes recover.

No matter the type, the benefits of massage really come down to one thing: pressure. ?The skin is moved during a moderate pressure massage, which results in a calming and slowing of the nervous system,? says Tiffany Field, PhD, director of the Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami School of Medicine. And that slowing of the nervous system leads to other physiological effects, too, like a decrease in heart rate, lowered blood pressure, and changes in EEG patterns (electrical activity in your brain), says Field.

Plus, in order to see those effects, it takes less time than you might think. ?For research, we?re able to document positive effects for massages that are only 20 minutes long,? says Mark Hyman Rapaport, MD, chief of psychiatric services at Emory Healthcare, who has led multiple studies focused on the effects of massage. That means when you go to get a massage (most of which are usually advertised for being around 50 minutes long, says Dr. Rapaport), you?re under pressure for more than enough time to see optimal benefits.

And if you can?t afford to head to the spa down the street? ?You do not need to go to a massage therapist all the time,? says Field. ?You can give yourself a massage.? Since we?re able to reach most areas on our body, you can do a 20-minute self-massage by using a massage brush in the shower or even rubbing a tennis ball against your limbs, she explains.

So if you?re thinking about booking a time or investing in a self-massager, here are six of the therapy?s biggest benefits to know about.
Relieve anxiety

If you suffer with anxiety, one study suggests that a massage can actually help significantly reduce your symptoms. ?What we think is going on is it?s decreasing the sympathetic tone that we see with people with generalized anxiety disorder and increasing this sort of parasympathetic response,? says Dr. Rapaport, who led the study.

Your body actually has two different nervous systems: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. ?Your sympathetic is fight or flight,? says Rudy Gehrman, DC, a sports medicine chiropractor and founder of Physio Logic in New York. ?If you?re getting chased by a lion, that?s your sympathetic nervous system.?

During a massage, however, your parasympathetic (or calming) response is increased, which results in a decrease in anxiety, says Dr. Rapaport.

And equally great news? Those effects of massage on decreased anxiety can actually be long-lasting. ?We did an informal follow-up, and a significant number of these people remained anxiety-free anywhere from six months to 18 months later,? says Dr. Rapaport.
Sleep more soundly

Have trouble sleeping or suffer from insomnia? Massage can actually help you sleep more deeply. ?Sleep is all related to how much activity there is in the nervous system,? says Field. And when you get a massage, your nervous system itself actually slows down due to the pressure.

Plus, when you?re getting deeper, more restorative sleep, she says, that in turn reduces your levels of substance P (a neurotransmitter for pain), which reduces overall pain. So if you have any aches, massage will do double-duty.

We?ve all been there: You?ve been tossing and turning all night, work has been completely draining, and you feel like you don?t even have five minutes to take a deep breath. ?Some people get fatigued because they?re not sleeping enough,? says Dr. Rapaport. ?Other people are getting fatigued because of some biological factors.?

But no matter what the cause of your fatigue is, one easy solution is (you guessed it) a massage. In fact, one 2018 study led by Dr. Rapaport found that breast cancer survivors who received weekly Swedish massages experienced a reduction in their fatigue, a particularly debilitating effect of the disease. To get the best effects, based on Dr. Rapaport?s study, try getting a massage once per week.
Aid certain health conditions

Your body has two different immune responses: Th1 and Th2, and they need to be in balance in order to have your immune system working optimally, says Field. ?If the Th2 gets in excess of the Th1 system, then you have autoimmune problems,? she says.

But during massage, you?re slowing down stress hormones to help maintain this balance, she says. In turn, this can help make autoimmune conditions like asthma, type 1 diabetes, or dermatitis, more manageable through things like decreased pain or fatigue.

Boost focus

Have trouble staying present in a meeting for more than 10 minutes or reading a book before bed? The effects of a massage will actually help improve your attention and ability to focus.

That?s because in order for you to best pay attention, your heart rate needs to be lowered. ?If I?m not paying attention, it?s usually because my heart rate?s elevated,? says Field. ?And when I get my heart rate down, I?ll be more attentive.?

Because a massage slows your nervous system, your heart rate is effectively slowed down, too. During a massage, your pressure receptors stimulate vagal activity, which stems from a nerve in your brain that leads to several different branches of the body, including the heart, says Field. So when you?re undergoing the pressure of a massage, it could decrease your heart rate, as well, which ultimately will improve your focus.
Heal injuries

If you experience an injury or joint pain (especially if the problem is long-term or chronic), says Gehrman, you?ll also have what are called soft-tissue restrictions, which cause knots or trigger points of pain. ?Massage therapists are getting rid of soft-tissue restrictions and increasing circulation,? he says.

Those restrictions can, over time, lead to problems like joint decay or other ligament problems, so by actively massaging out those soft-tissue restrictions, you?re not only helping your current injury, but also helping prevent against other problems down the road. But the important thing when getting a massage for your injury is going to an experienced, licensed massage therapist who has extensive experience with injured patients.

?Because any type of soft tissue work, you?re in essence causing scientific damage, and if you work too deep, then that person can?t heal from that treatment,? says Gehrman. A good, licensed massage therapist will be able to assess which areas around the injury need massage, and which areas are best to avoid.

Are there any massage risks?

Pregnant women should also seek out a therapist with pregnancy experience??For pregnant females, you have to be really, really careful with positioning,? says Gehrman.

People with osteoporosis should find a therapist with experience in that, as well. ?You can easily potentially break bones or ribs if a person is really, really osteoporotic,? says Gehrman.",NA
"6 Surprising Benefits of Massage Therapy

Sure, it can help you relax ? but massage therapy can do much more than that.

Benefits of Massage
#1: It counteracts all that sitting you do

?Most individuals are dealing with some kind of postural stress,? says Aaron Tanason, registered massage therapist, kinesiologist and owner at Paleolife Massage Therapy in Toronto. ?More often than not [that stress] tends to manifest in the shoulders and neck.? But desk workers, beware. More advanced forms of postural stress show up as pain or weakness in the low back and gluteals caused by prolonged periods of sitting. Here?s more on how sitting can impact your health.

And considering the benefits of massage therapy a quite unexpected, luckily, massage can counteract the imbalance caused from sitting. This means you can keep your desk job as long, as you schedule a regular massage.
#2: It eases muscle pain

Got sore muscles? Massage therapy can help. ?Massage increases and improves circulation. Just like rubbing your elbow when you knock it on a table helps to relieve the pain,? says Tanason.

A 2011 study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found benefits of massage therapy as effective as other methods of treatment for chronic back pain.
#3: It soothes anxiety and depression

?Human touch, in a context that is safe, friendly and professional, can be incredibly therapeutic and relaxing,? says Tanason. Women diagnosed with breast cancer who received massage therapy three times a week reported being less depressed and less angry, according to a 2005 study published in the International Journal of Neuroscience.

And, a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, found that patients who were depressed and anxious were much more relaxed and happy, and had reduced stress levels after massage.
#4: It improves sleep

Not only do benefits of massage encourage a restful sleep, it also helps those who can?t otherwise comfortably rest. ?Massage promotes relaxation and sleep in those undergoing chemo or radiation therapy,? says Lisa Marie de Miranda, registered massage therapist and kinesiologist at Paleolife Massage Therapy. Also, massages help infants sleep more, cry less and be less stressed, according to research from the University of Warwick.

Massage has been practiced for thousands of years. Today, if you need or want a massage, you can choose from about 80 massage therapy styles with a wide variety of pressures, movements, and techniques. These all involve pressing, rubbing, or manipulating muscles and other soft tissues with hands and fingers. Sometimes, even forearms, elbows, or feet are used.

According to the American Massage Therapy Association, up to 25 percent of American adults had a massage at least once during 2016-2017. And, they have a wide range of reasons for doing so. More and more people -- especially baby boomers -- recognize the health benefits of massage. They choose from among many massage styles to get relief from symptoms or to heal injuries, to help with certain health conditions, and to promote overall wellness.

Here is information you can use to help you decide what types of massage will work best for you.

Which Massage Styles Are Best?

You may have noticed that different massage styles are popular at different times. And you may have wondered whether each was just part of a passing fad or the latest, greatest massage technique? Even more important is how can you tell whether the latest style will actually help you?

Styles used in massage therapy range from long, smooth strokes to short, percussive strokes. Some massage therapists use oils and lotions; others do not. Most massage therapists have clients unclothe for a massage, but some do not. A massage can last anywhere from 5 minutes to 2 hours.

Before you can decide which massage style is best for you, you need to ask yourself a question. Do you simply want a massage for relaxation and stress control? Or do you need symptom relief or help with a certain health condition? Before booking a massage, let the therapist know what you're looking for and ask which style the therapist uses. Many use more than one style. Or the therapist may customize your massage, depending on your age, condition, or any special needs or goals you have.

What follows is a list of some of the more popular massage therapy styles. The first four are especially popular.","https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/massage-therapy-styles-and-health-benefits#1","massage benefits","google",NA,NA
"
Swedish Massage

The most common type of massage is Swedish massage therapy. It involves soft, long, kneading strokes, as well as light, rhythmic, tapping strokes, on topmost layers of muscles. This is also combined with movement of the joints. By relieving muscle tension, Swedish therapy can be both relaxing and energizing. And it may even help after an injury.

Four common strokes of Swedish massage are:

    Effleurage: a smooth, gliding stroke used to relax soft tissue
    Petrissage: the squeezing, rolling, or kneading that follows effleurage
    Friction: deep, circular movements that cause layers of tissue to rub against each other, helping to increase blood flow and break down scar tissue
    Tapotement: a short, alternating tap done with cupped hands, fingers, or the edge of the hand

Deep Tissue Massage

Deep tissue massage is best for giving attention to certain painful, stiff ""trouble spots"" in your body. The massage therapist uses slow, deliberate strokes that focus pressure on layers of muscles, tendons, or other tissues deep under your skin. Though less rhythmic than other types of massage, deep tissue massage may be therapeutic -- relieving chronic patterns of tension and helping with muscle injuries, such as back sprain.
Sports Massage

Developed to help with muscle systems used for a particular sport, sports massage uses a variety of approaches to help athletes in training -- before, during, or after sports events. You might use it to promote flexibility and help prevent injuries. Or, it may help muscle strains, aiding healing after a sports injury.
Chair Massage

Ever gone to a county fair, music festival, or conference and envied other people getting chair massages? Passed by the chair massage section in an airport? Or, maybe you're lucky enough to work at a company that offers 15- to 20-minute massages as a regular benefit. Onsite, chair massages are done while you're seated fully clothed in a portable, specially designed chair. They usually involve a massage of your neck, shoulders, back, arms, and hands.
Shiatsu Massage

In Japanese, shiatsu means ""finger pressure."" For shiatsu massage, the therapist uses varied, rhythmic pressure on certain precise points of the body. These points are called acupressure points, and they are believed to be important for the flow of the body's vital energy, called chi. Proponents say shiatsu massage can help relieve blockages at these acupressure points.","https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/massage-therapy-styles-and-health-benefits#2","massage benefits","google",NA,NA
"
Thai Massage

During a Thai massage, the therapist uses his or her body to move the client into a variety of positions. This type of massage includes compression of muscles, mobilization of joints, and acupressure.
Lymphatic Drainage Massage

A lymphatic drainage massage is gentle massge of your tissues designed to help increase the circulation of lymph fluids in your body.  Lymph is a protein-rich fluid that moves throughout your body in lymph vessels. It scoops up things like bacteria, viruses, and waste, and carries them to your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes then filter the fluid to get the impurities out of your body. The massage is usally done with light pressure with gentle, long strokes along the skin to increase the movement of lymph through your system.

Hot Stone Massage

For this kind of massage, the therapist places warmed stones on certain areas of the body, such as acupressure points. The stones may be used as massage tools or be temporarily left in place. Used along with other massage techniques, hot stones can be quite soothing and relaxing as they transmit heat deep into the body.
Reflexology

Reflexology uses hand, thumb, and finger techniques to stimulate certain areas of the feet. These areas are believed to correspond to different parts of the body. The massage, then, is expected to promote health and well-being.
Pregnancy Massage

During pregnancy, your body goes through major changes. Pregnancy massage can help with these changes by reducing stress, decreasing arm and leg swelling, and relieving muscle and joint pain. Massage may be particularly helpful during a time when medication and other medical options may be more limited. Using specially designed massage pillows, the massage therapist will help get you into a comfortable position for this type of massage.","https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/massage-therapy-styles-and-health-benefits#3","massage benefits","google",NA,NA

In physical therapy, trained professionals evaluate and treat abnormal physical function related to, for example, an injury, disability, disease or condition.

According to the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), a physical therapist is a trained and licensed medical professional with experience in diagnosing physical abnormalities, restoring physical function and mobility, maintaining physical function, and promoting physical activity and proper function.

Licensed physical therapists can be found in a range of healthcare settings including outpatient offices, private practices, hospitals, rehab centers, nursing homes, home health, sports and fitness settings, schools, hospices, occupational settings, government agencies, and research centers.
What to expect
Physical therapy can help people of all ages with a range of conditions.

A physical therapist helps take care of patients in all phases of healing, from initial diagnosis through the restorative and preventive stages of recovery. Physical therapy may be a standalone option, or it may support other treatments.

Some patients are referred to a physical therapist by their doctor, but other seek therapy themselves.

Whichever way a patient come to a physical therapist, they can expect to:

    Undergo a physical exam and evaluation, including a health history and certain testing procedures, including evaluation of posture, movement and flexibility, and of muscle and joint motion and performance
    Receive a clinical diagnosis, prognosis, plan of care and short and long term goals
    Receive physical therapy treatment and intervention based on the therapist?s evaluation and diagnosis
    Receive self-management recommendations

Patients often train with a physical therapist in exercises that they can do at home, to help them function more effectively.

Pediatric physical therapy aims to diagnose, treat, and manage conditions that affect infants, children, and adolescents, including developmental delays, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, torticollis and other conditions that impact the musculoskeletal system.

Wound care therapy can help to ensure that a healing wound is receiving adequate oxygen and blood by way of improved circulation. Physical therapy may include the use of manual therapies, electric stimulation, compression therapy and wound care.

Vestibular therapy aims to treat balance problems that can result from inner ear conditions. Vestibular physical therapy involves a number of exercises and manual techniques that can help patients regain their normal balance and coordination.

Decongestive therapy can help to drain accumulated fluid in patients with lymphedema and other conditions that involve fluid accumulation.

Pelvic floor rehabilitation can help treat urinary or fecal incontinence, urinary urgency and pelvic pain in men and women as a result of injuries or surgery, or because of certain conditions.

Apart from physical manipulation, physical therapy treatment may involve:

    Ultrasound, to promote blood flow and healing by heating the tendons, muscles, and tissues
    Phonophoresis, which uses ultrasound to deliver certain medications such as topical steroids. This can decrease the presence of inflammation
    Electrical stimulation, or E-stim, which uses topical electrodes on the skin to reduce pain and increase functional capabilities. One type of E-stim is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). At times, anti-inflammatory medications are used with certain E-stim modalities and is referred to as iontophoresis
    Heat, moist heat and cold therapy
    Light therapy, in which special lights and lasers are used to treat certain medical conditions

The physical therapist will recommend the most appropriate treatment.
Finding a physical therapist

Finding a suitable physical therapist can involve a number of factors, including insurance acceptance, specialty and reason for treatment, and geographical location.

Insurance companies often have lists of physical therapy locations who participate in specific health plans. Other healthcare providers may have a list of therapists in the area whom they recommend.

Another way to find a physical therapist is to look online or access the APTA Find a PT web-based tool.
Training to be a physical therapist

During several years of training, physical therapists study areas such as biology, anatomy, cellular histology, physiology, exercise physiology, biomechanics, kinesiology, neuroscience, pharmacology, pathology, behavioral sciences, cardiovascular and pulmonary, endocrine and metabolic, and musculoskeletal studies.

Physical therapists can specialize in fields such as:

    Cardiovascular and pulmonary health
    Clinical electrophysiology
    Health for older people
    Neurology, orthopedics, pediatrics, sports physical therapy, and women?s health. 

According to the World Confederation for Physical Therapy, this type of treatment benefits not only the physical body.

It:

    ?Is concerned with identifying and maximizing quality of life and movement potential within the spheres of promotion, prevention, treatment/intervention, habilitation and rehabilitation. This encompasses physical, psychological, emotional, and social wellbeing.?

For more information on the benefits of physical therapy and how it may help, patients should speak with their healthcare provider or a physical therapist. ","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/160645","physical therapy benefits","google",NA,NA

10 Reasons Why Physical Therapy is Beneficial
October 20, 2015

    Therapy

Comments

Physical therapy in NYPhysical therapy helps people of all ages who have medical conditions, illnesses or injuries that limit their regular ability to move and function.

A customized physical therapy program can help individuals return to their prior level of functioning, and encourage activities and lifestyle changes that can help prevent further injury and improve overall health and well being. Primary care doctors often refer patients to physical therapy at the first sign of a problem, since it is considered a conservative approach to managing problems. Wondering what makes physical therapy so important? In honor of Physical Therapy month in October, here are 10 ways it may benefit you: 

    Reduce or eliminate pain. Therapeutic exercises and manual therapy techniques such as joint and soft tissue mobilization or treatments such as ultrasound, taping or electrical stimulation can help relieve pain and restore muscle and joint function to reduce pain. Such therapies can also prevent pain from returning.
     
    Avoid surgery. If physical therapy helps you eliminate pain or heal from an injury, surgery may not be needed. And even if surgery is required, you may benefit from pre-surgery physical therapy. If you are going into a surgery stronger and in better shape, you will recover faster afterwards in many cases. Also, by avoiding surgery, health care costs are reduced.
     
    Improve mobility. If you?re having trouble standing, walking or moving?no matter your age?physical therapy can help. Stretching and strengthening exercises help restore your ability to move. Physical therapists can properly fit individuals with a cane, crutches or any other assistive device, or assess for orthotic prescription. By customizing an individual care plan, whatever activity that is important to an individual?s life can be practiced and adapted to ensure maximal performance and safety.
     
    Recover from a stroke. It?s common to lose some degree of function and movement after stroke. Physical therapy helps strengthen weakened parts of the body and improve gait and balance. Physical therapists can also improve stroke patients? ability to transfer and move around in bed so that they can be more independent around the home, and reduce their burden of care for toileting, bathing, dressing and other activities of daily living.
     
    Recover from or prevent a sports injury. Physical therapists understand how different sports can increase your risk for specific types of injuries (such as stress fractures for distance runners). They can design appropriate recovery or prevention exercise programs for you to ensure a safe return to your sport.
     
    Improve your balance and prevent falls . When you begin physical therapy, you will get screened for fall risk. If you?re at high risk for falls, therapists will provide exercises that safely and carefully challenge your balance as a way to mimic real-life situations. Therapists also help you with exercises to improve coordination and assistive devices to help with safer walking. When the balance problem is caused by a problem in one?s vestibular system, Physical therapists can perform specific maneuvers that can quickly restore proper vestibular functioning, and reduce and eliminate symptoms of dizziness or vertigo.
     
    Manage diabetes and vascular conditions. As part of an overall diabetes management plan, exercise can help effectively control blood sugar.  Additionally, people with diabetes may have problems with sensation in their feet and legs. Physical therapists can help provide and educate these patients on proper foot care to prevent further problems down the road.
     
    Manage age-related issues . As individuals age, they may develop arthritis or osteoporosis or need a joint replacement. Physical therapists are experts in helping patients recover from joint replacement, and manage arthritic or osteoporotic conditions conservatively.
     
    Manage heart and lung disease. While patients may complete cardiac rehabilitation after a heart attack or procedure, you also may receive physical therapy if your daily functioning is affected. For pulmonary problems, physical therapy can improve quality of life through strengthening, conditioning and breathing exercises, and help patients clear fluid in the lungs.
     
    Manage Women?s Health and other conditions. Women have specific health concerns, such as with pregnancy and post-partum care. Physical therapists can offer specialized management of issues related to women?s health. Additionally, PT can provide specialized treatment for:  Bowel incontinence, breast cancer, constipation, fibromyalgia, lymphedema, male pelvic health, pelvic pain, and urinary incontinence.

If you have questions about how physical therapy may help you or someone you care about, please don?t hesitate to ask your health care provider or local PT for information.

Physical Therapy for Chronic Pain: What to Expect
In this Article

    How Does Physical Therapy Treat Pain?
    What Else Might I Do?
    Will It Hurt?

Physical therapy is often one of the best choices you can make when you have long-term pain (also called chronic pain) or an injury. It can make you stronger and help you move and feel better.

Ask your doctor to recommend a physical therapist. You'll probably need a series of visits, and you should practice some of the exercises at home for the best results.

Physical therapists have a lot of training. Still, it?s a good idea to ask them about their experience in working with people who've had conditions like yours. You can also ask them how many sessions you'll need.
How Does Physical Therapy Treat Pain?

Physical therapists are experts not only in treating pain, but also its source. Yours will look for areas of weakness or stiffness that may be adding stress to the places that hurt. And they will treat those areas with certain exercises to ease pain and help you move better.

In a physical therapy session, you may do a mix of:

Low-impact aerobic training. These workouts will rev up your heart rate and still take it easy on your joints. For instance, you might walk fast or use a stationary bike to warm up, instead of running, before you do your strengthening exercises.

you might like

Strengthening exercises. You might use machines at your physical therapist?s office, resistance bands, or your own body weight (think lunges, squats, and pushups). You may work on your core muscles (belly, glutes, and back), as well as other parts of your body.

Pain relief exercises. These moves target areas where you have pain, so you're stronger and more flexible -- which should make it easier to live your life.

Stretching. This will be gentle, and your therapist will make sure that you're warmed up and you don?t stretch too far.

Your physical therapist may prescribe exercises for you to do at home.
What Else Might I Do?

During your sessions, your therapist may also use:

Heat and ice packs. Ice calms inflammation. Heat warms up your muscles so they move better. Both can help with pain.","https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/physical-therapy#1","physical therapy benefits","google",NA,NA

Physical Therapy for Chronic Pain: What to Expect

    How Does Physical Therapy Treat Pain?
    What Else Might I Do?
    Will It Hurt?

Massage. Keep in mind that a massage on areas that are injured, sore, or hurt may not feel relaxing. But your therapist will take great care to make sure it?s safe and helpful for you. If you get one by someone other than her, tell that professional about your pain before your session starts.

TENS and ultrasound. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS, uses a device to send a low-voltage electric current to the skin over the area where you have pain. Ultrasound sends sound waves to the areas that hurt. Both may offer relief by blocking the pain messages that go to your brain.
Continue Reading Below
Will It Hurt?

Physical therapy shouldn?t hurt, and it will be safe. But because you'll use parts of your body that are injured or have chronic pain, physical therapy can be challenging, even hard. For example, you may feel sore after stretching or deep tissue massage.

But there?s a reason for that. Your therapist has a specific plan in mind based on your particular needs. Sometimes to get stronger, you have to do some tough training. It will push you, but it shouldn't be too much.

Each person may respond differently to therapy. Your body type, daily activities, alignment, and habits all affect your plan. Stick with it, and you'll get the benefits.","https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/physical-therapy#2","physical therapy benefits","google",NA,NA

Benefits of a Physical Therapist Career

There are many reasons you should consider a career in physical therapy.

Make a Difference. ""Being a physical therapist is very rewarding. You will work with patients one-on-one, see them progress through treatment, and know that you are really making a difference in their lives,"" said APTA spokesperson Meredith Harris, PT, DPT, EdD. Whether the patient's problem is a result of injury or disease, the physical therapist is a rehabilitation specialist who fosters the patient's return to maximal function. Physical therapists also will work with individuals to prevent loss of mobility by developing fitness- and wellness-oriented programs for healthier and more active lifestyles.

Be a Movement Expert. Physical therapists are highly educated experts in the movement and function of the human body. The goal of a physical therapist is to promote the patient's ability to move, reduce pain, restore function, and prevent disability. Physical therapy is an essential element of patient care. Therapeutic exercise and functional training are the cornerstones of physical therapist treatment. Depending on the particular needs of a patient, physical therapists may ""mobilize"" a joint or massage a muscle to promote proper movement and function. Physical therapists may use other techniques such as electrotherapy, ultrasound (high-frequency waves that produce heat), hot packs, and ice in addition to other treatments when appropriate.

Enjoy Job Security. For Americans looking for a rewarding career in a struggling job market and down economy, a career in physical therapy could be the perfect answer. The soaring demand for physical therapists can be attributed to the aging American population, particularly baby boomers who are more vulnerable to chronic and debilitating conditions that require physical therapist services. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demand for physical therapists is expected to spike upward by an astonishing 34% between 2014 and 2024?a much quicker rate than average. Currently, there are approximately 210,900  licensed physical therapists in the United States, and that number is expected to jump to 282,700 by 2024.

Love Your Job. Helping people to attain or regain the ability to walk and carry out daily life can lead to a great feeling of personal satisfaction. Physical therapists report one of the highest job-satisfaction levels in the country! Forbes ranked physical therapists as having 1 of ""The Ten Happiest Jobs,"" according to articles published in 2013 and 2011. CNNMoney.com gave physical therapists a grade of ?A? in Personal Satisfaction in 2012, as well as in its ?Benefit to Society? categories. A National Opinion Research Center survey, which was chronicled in an April 17, 2007, article of the Chicago Tribune. With more than three-quarters of physical therapists polled reporting to be ""very satisfied"" with their occupations, PTs were second only to clergy, and were the only health care professionals in the top 5.

Choose Your Location. Physical therapists work with patients of all ages all across the country. Choose from a wide range of locations and work settings, including hospitals, private practices, outpatient clinics, home health agencies, schools, sports and fitness facilities, employer settings, and nursing homes.

Be an Entrepreneur. Do you want to be your own boss? More than twenty-one percent (21.6%) of physical therapists are owners of, or partners in, a physical therapy practice.","https://www.apta.org/PTCareers/Benefits/","physical therapy benefits","google",NA,NA
"The Benefits of Physical Therapy
Posted: 10/28/2019
The Benefits of Physical Therapy

When people think of physical therapy, or PT, they usually associate it with someone who was injured. For example, someone who was in a bad car accident or suffered from a stroke, might use physical therapy to help them recover. But physical therapy isn?t just for those who suffer from physical injuries. PT can be used by anyone looking to improve their mobility, manage pain and chronic conditions, recover from injury, and prevent future injury and chronic disease.

Physical therapy is performed by a physical therapist (PT), sometimes with the help of a physical therapist assistant (PTA). PTs and PTAs are experts in movement in the body who can improve a patient?s quality of life through exercise regimens, hands-on care, and education. They will assess your current ability and review your goals in order to create a treatment plan to meet your needs. PTs can be found in hospital or out-patient settings, health care practices (as is the case of CCP?s physical therapy services), fitness facilities, nursing homes, and so on. This makes it easy to access their services from almost anywhere. PTs and PTAs are able to work collaboratively with the rest of your health care team to ensure you are receiving the best care. Your primary care practitioner may refer you to a physical therapist for several different reasons.
Substitute for Surgery

One common reason someone may use physical therapy is to avoid surgery. Since surgery is oftentimes expensive and invasive, many patients would prefer to avoid it if possible. For example, if you were injured or are suffering from conditions like meniscal tears, spinal stenosis, and degenerative dish disease, physical therapy has actually been found to be as effective as surgery.
Pain Management

Physical therapy is also being used more and more in cases of pain management over prescribing opioids. This is because the CDC is encouraging health care practitioners to recommend safer alternatives for their patients. Opioids can cause depression, addiction, withdrawal symptoms, and, in some cases, overdose which can cause death. Physical therapy is one of the safer alternatives recommended by the CDC to help patients manage long-term pain since it may actually work better and has fewer risks and side effects.
Recovery and Injury Prevention

Physical therapy can also be recommended for those who are recovering from an injury and need to strengthen their movements. This can include anyone who has suffered from an accident or condition that has caused mobility issues that impact their daily lives. PT can also be used on a more long-term basis if a patient is considered to be at high risk of re-injuring themselves. People who play sports or have physically demanding jobs may be some of the patients who would utilize this service.
General Mobility Concerns

Patients who are older or who are suffering from health conditions that affect their daily movement can also benefit from seeing a physical therapist. Fall prevention is important as these falls can cause injury, loss of independence and, in extreme cases, even death. PTs can also help with general mobility concerns, especially when the mobility issues are affecting a patient?s quality of life.

If you suffer from mobility issues, you should have a conversation with your primary care practitioner to determine whether you could benefit from seeing a physical therapist. If you are in need of PT services, then consider using Community Care Physical Therapy. Our office gives patients an alternative to the hospitals and big rehabilitation centers and our physical therapists are known for their professionalism, expertise and personal attention to patients. We help patients make positive changes in their lifestyle and regain control over their bodies.","https://www.communitycare.com/News/Health-Blog-Article?URLName=The-Benefits-of-Physical-Therapy","physical therapy benefits","google",NA,NA

A physical therapist is a specialist trained to work with you to restore your activity, strength, and motion following an injury or surgery. Physical therapists can teach specific exercises, stretches, and techniques and use specialized equipment to address problems that cannot be managed without this specialized physical therapy training.
Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation

Physical therapists are trained to identify deficiencies in the biomechanics of the body. Working with a physical therapist can target specific areas of weakness in the way our bodies work. They can relieve stress and help the body function without pain.

Physical therapists are knowledgeable about surgical procedures and treatment goals and can tailor their efforts to improve their well-being. After surgical procedures, it is important that therapy is guided by the surgical procedure. Physical therapists are knowledgeable about your body's limitations after surgery and can help ensure a successful outcome.1

?
Stretching Tight Muscles and Joints

Stretching is vital in maintaining a good range of motion with joints and the flexibility of muscles. If you have stiff joints or tight muscles, normal activities, such as climbing stairs or reaching overhead, can be severely affected. With proper stretching, these functions can be preserved.

After an injury or surgery, scar tissue forms and soft tissue contracts. It is important to regularly stretch in these situations to ensure that scar formation does not get in the way of your rehabilitation.
Exercises to Strengthen Your Body

Strengthening exercises are performed to help you improve the function of your muscles. The goal is to improve strength, increase endurance and maintain or improve range of motion.

Post-operative exercises should always be guided by your doctor and physical therapist, as there may be specific restrictions for your injury. The following guidelines can help you along your way for knee Injuries, shoulder injuries, back injuries, and neck injuries.
Core Strengthening and Stability

One of the most recent developments in physical therapy is the emphasis on core strengthening and stability.2? The core of your body is like the foundation of your house. If you were to build your house on a weak foundation, you could risk damage and collapse. Similarly, bodies with a weak core are susceptible to acute injury and chronic overuse syndromes.

Core strengthening emphasizes the muscles of the back and pelvis. Some exercise programs, especially pilates, are fantastic at increasing the body's core stability. That is the reason many professional athletes do regular pilates workouts.
Ice and Heat Application

Ice and heat are useful in warming up and cooling off muscles.3? In addition, these methods can stimulate blood flow and decrease swelling. These can be important aspects of the therapeutic process. The key to proper ice and heat treatment is knowing when to ice and heat an injury.
Ultrasound

Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves (not within the range we can hear) to stimulate the deep tissues within the body.4? By passing an ultrasound probe over your body, deep tissues are stimulated by the vibration of the sound wave. This leads to warming and increased blood flow to these tissues.
Electrical Stimulation

Electrical stimulation is a therapy that passes an electrical current to an affected area. Nerve conduction within the region is altered, which can, in turn, alter muscle contractility. Blood flow to these tissues is also increased with electrical stimulation. Patients often experience diminished pain after this electrical stimulation of treatment.5?","https://www.verywellhealth.com/physical-therapy-a2-2549751","physical therapy benefits","google",NA,NA
"The Role of Physical Therapy

The role of physical therapy is to help regain and restore the pain-free and comfortable movement and overall health that a person experienced prior to an injury, illness or disability.

To achieve this, the physical therapist will design and monitor a planned program using a holistic approach. The goal is both to restore physical health, quality of life and overall wellness to the patient, while minimizing the risk of injury or illness in the future.

Physical therapy can be helpful for people of all ages, with a wide range of health conditions. The role of the referring primary care physician and family members or care-givers, will always be included in the plan, wherever this is appropriate or required.

Physical Therapy Instruction Rotator Cuff
A conservative approach to managing problems

In many cases, the patient will have approached a physician seeking relief from physical pain. They may be experiencing a nagging lower back pain, shoulder pain or knee pain that is affecting their quality of life. Because physical therapy is the most conservative and least intrusive approach to managing health problems, doctors regularly refer patients to a physical therapist as a first resort. Many doctors report that once patients understand and accept the benefits of the program, they respond quickly and positively, with excellent results
Pain relief ? the first and most obvious benefit.

Physical therapy can successfully alleviate the majority of painful musculoskeletal conditions. Chronic pain can be one of the most frustrating conditions to experience, especially if the underlying cause is unknown. However, physical therapy techniques and therapeutic exercises can help mobilize the patient?s joints and soft tissue and restore muscle function, reducing aches or eliminating pain altogether. Provided patients continue to perform the prescribed physical exercises regularly, it can keep the pain from returning.
An important corollary ? avoiding the need for surgery

A number of studies have shown that physical therapy may often be as effective as surgery for providing pain relief. One example is in the case of lower back conditions, many of which are shown to respond very favorably to non-invasive physical therapy.

Wherever the more conservative approach is appropriate, it is obviously to the benefit of the patient to explore that route first. Given the proper treatment, the body can often heal itself without the need for surgery.
Recovery post-surgery

Where surgery is obviously the only choice, as for example, in repairing a fractured hip, the patient will start on a properly planned regimen of exercises as soon as possible after the surgery. The role of the physical therapist then becomes paramount in guiding the healing process.

When surgery is required, there may also be a benefit from pre-surgery physical therapy. Because it strengthens the patient, it enables faster recovery after the surgery.
Improving general mobility

Physical Therapy Mobility

At all stages in life, mobility can become an issue. This may be due to a minor accident, aging, sports injuries or the sedentary life-style that so many people lead. Even in advanced or chronic cases, and at all ages, physical therapy can be extremely advantageous in ameliorating problems with walking or moving. The classic stretching and strengthening exercises can restore movement to a large degree and re-enable the quality of life the person experienced before.
Other Health Issues

Recovery from serious illnesses such as a stroke or a heart attack can often be assisted in large measure by a physical therapy program designed to help the weakened parts of the body recover.

Aerobic and body strengthening exercises are also of great value managing diabetes by controlling blood sugar levels.

Arthritis and osteoporosis which may develop with age, can affect joints and mobility. The effects of these conditions can be greatly reduced and controlled by properly designed stretching exercises.
Physical Therapy with children

It is perhaps a common misconception that physical therapy is largely limited to adult conditions. In fact, it also plays a very important role treating children who have motor skill issues. These can often result in behavioral problems and impinge on the general cognitive development of the child.

Physical therapy can assist children to improve the fine motor skills that may have been impaired by neurological causes such as cerebral palsy and are very effective when aiding recovering from surgery.
Modern lifestyles and obesity in children

With modern sedentary lifestyles resulting in children being far less active than was the norm a few decades ago, a lot of attention is being focused on how to solve this problem. Spending hours playing games on their phones and computer related hardware, or texting with their friends, the need for reintroducing proper exercise has become paramount. Obesity and its related ills are affecting children to a degree unheard of before, and the physical therapist can play a powerful role in helping to design programs to combat this.
What the future holds

Across the age spectrum the need to promote fitness and mobility is one of the most important health issues facing society today. The goal of physical therapy is to solve as many of the health-related issues as possible, and the work of the physical therapist will doubtless play an increasingly large role going forward.","https://www.physicaltherapyfirst.com/2018/10/12/key-benefits-and-goals-of-physical-therapy/","physical therapy benefits","google",NA,NA

The Top 7 Benefits of Physical Therapy

By Laura Slade on Apr 6, 2018 8:40:00 AM
Topics: Physical Therapy

Physical therapy has proven to be beneficial to people of all ages, with a wide variety of conditions, illnesses, or injuries. From increased mobility to improved overall health, there are numerous ways physical therapy can change a patient?s quality of life. Let?s delve deeper into the top 7 ways physical therapy positively impacts those who partake in it.
Reduce or eliminate pain.

This benefit is the one most commonly associated with physical therapy. Through therapeutic exercises and manual therapy techniques, physical therapists can reduce their patients? pain levels and even prevent pain from returning in the future. Other therapies include joint and soft tissue mobilization, taping, and even electrical stimulation.

kylie renner gif
Be an alternative to surgery.

Obviously this benefit is not applicable in every situation that requires surgery: all the physical therapy in the world can?t help an inflamed appendix or a heart-valve defect. But in the case of muscle damage, physical therapy can reduce pain and aid in healing, potentially eliminating the need for surgery all together. And even when surgery is required, pre-surgery physical therapy may also help ensure a speedy recovery.

Improve mobility.

Regardless of a patient?s age or physical fitness, stretching and strengthening exercises can help restore your ability to move. Especially for individuals who rely on a cane, crutches, or any other assistive device, an individual care plan developed by their physical therapist can ease the strain and stress of movement.

Help patients recover from a stroke.

After a stroke, it?s fairly common to lose some degree of function and movement. Physical therapy can help patients regain gait and balance, as well as strengthening weakened parts of the body.

Aid in recovery from sports related injuries.

Athletes at every level face the risk of injuring themselves. Stress fractures, torn muscles, strained tendons; physical therapists rely on their knowledge of the body to create an appropriate recovery or prevention exercise programs to help enable their patients a speedy return to their respective sports.

Improve balance and prevent falls.

When a patient begins a physical therapy treatment, they?re often screened for fall risk. If they?re at high risk, their physical therapist will lead them through exercises that safely challenge their balance. Other exercises might be used to help improve coordination?incorporating an assistive device for walking, for example. If the balance problem is caused by a problem in a patient?s vestibular system?such as vertigo?there are specific maneuvers that a therapist will perform to help alleviate symptoms.

Aid in managing diabetes and vascular conditions.

Patients with diabetes may have problems with sensation in their feet and legs. Physical therapists will educate these patients on proper foot care, to help avoid further complications later on. Exercise can also help control blood sugar levels.

Physical therapy and the therapists that practice are integral to the improved health, mobility, and quality of life for many patients. And the history behind their branch of medicine is an interesting one?as discussed in our previous blog.","https://www.insynchcs.com/blog/the-top-7-benefits-of-physical-therapy","physical therapy benefits","google",NA,NA

The Challenges and Benefits of Treatment for Mental Health

At first thought, asking for help seems like an easy thing to do. If you can?t do something on your own, the obvious next step is to ask someone else for assistance. How hard can it be, right? When it comes to mental health, asking for help can be incredibly difficult.

However, the benefits of getting treatment for mental health far outweigh the challenge of overcoming the initial fear of seeking help.
Why Is It so Hard to Seek Treatment?

According to government statistics, nearly half of all youth ages 8 to 15 with a mental illness receive no treatment. Studies have been conducted to determine the reasons for this disparity, and there is no single answer.

Some reasons have to do with environment, economics and other overarching factors. In some cases, the mental disorder itself may create conditions that prevent the individual from seeking help. For adolescents, the following were identified as particular issues that made it hard to reach out:

    Stigma and Embarrassment. Negative and judgmental attitudes toward mental illness create shame and fear of being identified with the mentally ill.
    Difficulty Recognizing Symptoms. Some young people aren?t sure how to identify whether their problems are typical or if they indicate an underlying mental illness.
    Preference for Self-Reliance. During their developmental years, teens commonly begin asserting their own independence. This tendency may cause a preference for relying on themselves.
    Lack of Trust. From general awkwardness of sharing personal details to fears of exposure, distrust often becomes a barrier.
    Feelings of Hopelessness. Those especially burdened by their symptoms may have a perception of hopelessness that contributes to a diminished desire for help.

Benefits of Getting Treatment for Mental Health

Thankfully, identifying the benefits of treatment is easier than figuring out why it?s hard to ask for help. If you understand the how much you have to gain, you will be more inclined to seek help.

Depending on your specific situation, there will be particular advantages for getting treatment. But considering the overall benefits of mental health treatment is a great place to start:

    Improved quality of life. Imagine being free of the symptoms you?re currently facing. Without depression, anxiety, stress and other psychological problems to weigh you down, you can live your life to the fullest.
    Improved relationships. When your strength isn?t being sapped by the symptoms of the illness, you?re better able to develop and maintain healthy relationships, and you?ll have more time for the people in your life.
    Reduced chance for complications. Many people with mental illness unfortunately also develop substance addictions, but getting mental health treatment diminishes that possibility. Even if drugs or alcohol are already a problem, dual diagnosis treatment can help with both conditions.
    Better performance at school or work. Improved concentration, enhanced creativity, reduced absenteeism, increased productivity and better overall performance are all very real benefits of good mental health.
    Reduced risk for medical issues. Untreated mental illness contributes to physical problems like heart disease, ulcers and colitis and also reduces the strength of your immune system. Getting treatment decreases your potential need for certain medical services.
    Encouragement and Support. Individual therapy enables you to better understand yourself and your personal goals. Group therapy provides exposure to others with similar struggles, which can offer fresh perspectives on difficult problems. All of this gives you needed strength for continued recovery.

Tips for Asking for Help

Remember, there is nothing shameful about seeking help. Initially you may feel vulnerable and unsure, but asking for help is essential. Good mental health treatment will set you on a path of recovery that enables you to truly enjoy your life. Here are some basic tips to help you overcome your own reluctance to seeking assistance:

    Ask for help before frustration and anger take over. If you wait until the problems are severe, you may be too overwhelmed to ask for help.
    Leave behind feelings of weakness, shame and embarrassment. Asking for help doesn?t mean you?re a failure. It?s actually the best and wisest strategy for success in overcoming your struggles.
    Talk to someone you trust. If you?re not sure where to start or are feeling intimidated about dealing with professionals, start with a friend or family member. They can point you in the right direction and work with you to find the best source of treatment.
    Be clear and direct when asking for help. If you?re not specific, others may completely miss your plea for help. Vague comments are easily missed or misunderstood, so be as precise as possible.
    Be as positive as you can. It?s understandable that negativity creeps in when you?re wrestling with real problems. But try to abstain from whining or complaining. Also be kind and gentle; avoid making demands or threats. Bad attitudes can turn people away just when you need them most.","https://www.destinationsforteens.com/destinations-blog/the-challenge-and-benefits-of-seeking-treatment-for-mental-health/","mental health services benefits","google",NA,NA

Five Warning Signs of Mental Illness

learn the warning signs of mental illness

It is too easy to go about our busy lives and not notice symptoms of physical or mental illness. Our body has built-in warning systems which alert us to the signs that we need to pay attention. 
Here are five warning signs of mental illness to watch for especially when you have two or more of these symptoms.

    Long-lasting sadness or irritability
    Extremely high and low moods
    Excessive fear, worry, or anxiety
    Social withdrawal
    Dramatic changes in eating or sleeping habits

Below are a couple of self-report tests for warning signs of mental illness, which you can complete and score to see if you might be experiencing clinical depression.  Keep in mind that depression can include anxiety symptoms, and when combined with an extreme shift in moods, then bipolar disorder is further evaluated.   There are many other self-report mental health screening tools which you may consider, i.e., PBHCI ? Mental Health Screening.
The PHQ-2 in Figure 1 Warning Signs of Mental Illness, below inquiries about the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past two weeks. 

The PHQ-2 includes the first two items of the PHQ-9.  The purpose of the PHQ-2 is not to establish a final diagnosis or to monitor depression severity, but rather to screen for depression in a ?first step? approach.  Patients who screen positive should be further evaluated with the PHQ-9 to determine whether they meet criteria for a depressive disorder.  When scoring the PHQ-2, the range is from 0-6. 
The authors identified a PHQ-2 cutoff score of three:

    As the optimal cut point for screening purposes and stated that a cut point of two
    Would enhance sensitivity, whereas a cut point of four
    Would improve specificity.

Figure 1 Warning Signs of Mental Illness

The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2)

(Kroenke, K. et al., 2003)

If you scored 3 or above, you might proceed to answer the questions in the self-report PHQ-9. The PHQ-9 in Figure 2 below is a multipurpose instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression. 

The PHQ-9 incorporates DSM-IV depression diagnostic criteria with other leading major depressive symptoms into a brief self-report tool.  The tool rates the frequency of the symptoms that factors into the scoring severity index.  Question 9 on the PHQ-9 screens for the presence and duration of suicide ideation. 

A follow-up, the non-scored question on the PHQ-9 screens and assigns weight to the degree to which depressive problems have affected the patient?s level of functioning.  This tool is brief and useful in clinical practice. 

The PHQ-9 can also be administered more than one time as an assessment tool to monitor improvement or increased levels of depression in response to treatment. 

The PHQ-9 can make a tentative depression diagnosis.  However, physical/environmental causes of depression, i.e., normal bereavement, or a history of manic/hypomanic episode should be taken into consideration. 

It is always best to ask your primary care provider if it would be helpful to be further evaluated by a mental health professional who can assist with psychotropic medication management and to ascertain your levels of depression in response to the treatment plan.

Figure 2 Warning Signs of Mental Illness

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)

(Kroenke, K. et al., 2001)

Overview for scoring the PHQ-9 is as follows: 

Step 1:  Questions 1 and 2 ? Need one or both of the first two questions endorsed as a ?2? or a ?3? (2 = ?More than half the days? or 3 = ?Nearly every day?). 

Step 2: Questions 1 through 9 ? Need a total of five or more boxes endorsed within the shaded area of the form to arrive at the total symptom count (Questions 1-8 must be endorsed as a ?2? or a ?3,? and Question 9 must be endorsed as ?1? a ?2? or a ?3?).
Use of the PQH-9 for treatment selection and monitoring as follows: 

Step 1:  A depression diagnosis that warrants treatment or a treatment change, needs at least one of the first two questions endorsed as positive (?more than half the days? or ?nearly every day?) in the past two weeks.  Also, the tenth question, about difficulty at work or home or getting along with others should be answered at least ?somewhat difficult.? 

Step 2:  Add the total points for each of the columns 2-4 separately (Column 1 = several days; Column 2 = More than half the days, Column 3 = Nearly every day.  Add the totals for each of the three columns together.  This is the Total Score that equals the Severity Score. 

Step 3:  Review the Severity Score using the following TABLE for PHQ-9 Scoring:

++ If symptoms present > one month or severe functional impairment, consider active treatment.* If symptoms present > two years, then probable chronic depression which warrants antidepressants and psychotherapy (ask yourself, ?in the past two years have I felt depressed or sad most days, even if I felt okay sometimes??)

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) each illness has its own set of symptoms, some combined, but here are some other common warning signs of mental illness in adults and adolescents.

    Confused thinking or problems concentrating and learning
    Extreme mood changes, including uncontrollable ?highs? or feelings of euphoria
    Prolonged or strong feelings of irritability or anger
    Difficulties understanding or relating to other people
    Changes in sex drive
    Difficulty perceiving reality (delusions or hallucinations, in which a person experiences and senses things that don?t exist in objective reality)
    Inability to perceive changes in one?s own feelings, behavior or personality (? lack of insight? or anosognosia)
    Abuse of substances like alcohol or drugs
    Multiple physical ailments without obvious causes (such as headaches, stomach aches, vague and ongoing ?aches and pains?)
    Thinking about suicide
    Inability to carry out daily activities or handle daily problems and stress
    An intense fear of weight gain or concern with appearance

The good news is that you can go to your primary care provider and be prepared to talk about any of the symptoms you have been experiencing.  Most primary care offices use the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 as valid screening tools. 

If you decide to complete the self-report brief screening tools, you may complete and take with you to your medical doctor.  Some primary care physicians will feel comfortable prescribing an anti-depressant.  Some of the primary care clinics like the Federally Qualified Healthcare Clinics (FQHC?s) offer same day service with the medical provider and a behavioral health consultant, psychologist or a licensed mental health therapist.  They form what is called a primary care team who work to promote healing for the ?whole person.?

The first step is getting a diagnosis and learning about your choices for treatment. Treatment goals have objectives that can help improve your daily living activities (DLA?s) for functioning at work, home, church, and other activities.  There is no ?one size fits all types of treatment.?  Treatment options may include psychotropic medication, counseling (therapy), social support and psychoeducation.

Another first step is to love yourself and significant others in your life enough to ?lovingly accept help.?  Affirm this ? ?For good and for bad, in sickness and in health, I love myself and others unconditionally.?  When we do this, we can change, grow, and expand our life to reach out and offer help to others.  When we are healthy, we feel better about ourselves and mindful of our blessings with deep gratitude for life.

The second step is to gain hope for healing to have clarity for knowing your life purpose. With faith in a ?Higher Power,? you find meaning and purpose and grow stronger day by day.  Good Health is a blessing and we must be aware of any warning signs, so we can get help and begin to feel better.  We must acknowledge self-care and know that ?we are worth it.?

"The Benefits of Mental Health According to Science

    Kelly Miller, BA, CAPP 8 18-02-2020

Mental Health BenefitsThe absence of mental illness does not equal mental health. Just as the lack of physical illness does not equal physical wellness.

To reap the benefits of mental health, special attention to the growth of practices that improve mental health is necessary. There?s, unfortunately, no magic wand, magic pill, or special potion that will move someone along the continuum of mental health.

Personal intention and consistent practice of daily interventions are vital to realizing the benefits. Consider your mental health like a piggy bank. We will inevitably have interactions and experiences that are negative that deplete that bank. Those who have a consistent practice in boosting mental health have a larger account in which they regularly deposit those dividends.

Being ?north of neutral? doesn?t happen by accident. Let?s explore where you can see some of these benefits. Improving your mental health improves not only you but also the world around you. The state of our mental health affects our relationships. Imagine the possibilities of realizing the benefits of positive mental health.

The Benefits of Mental Health

The benefits of intentionally practicing to improve mental health are a response to the chronic stress reported at epidemic levels around the world. Chronic stress has been proven to deteriorate the hippocampus (McLaughlin, 2007).

This stress also leads to decreased concentration and memory, confusion, loss of sense of humor, anger, irritability, and fear. Obviously, stress is not good for the brain, and improved mental health practices can reduce the risk.

Other benefits of mental health include, but aren?t limited to:

    Reduction in anxiety.
    Improved moods.
    Clearer thinking.
    A greater sense of calm or inner peace.
    Increased self-esteem.
    Reduced risk of depression.
    Improvements in relationships.

The development of practical coping skills has never been more necessitated in this ever-changing world. Rather than continuing to simply soldier on, a focus on thriving through adversity is where mental health benefits can be achieved. Improved mental health has been well documented with the introduction of improved levels of physical fitness.

The fitness industry has decades of research showing the benefits of taking special and intentional care of one?s body. The concept of being mentally healthy is not necessarily new, but it certainly has more areas of growth in scientific research. This is likely because historically, medicine has studied what was wrong so that it could be cured.

A more recent approach to physical and mental well-being has been prevention. Exercise is a preventative activity for both physical and mental health. When you strengthen your body, there is less pain in aging. The same can be said for strengthening our mental health.

Benefits of mental health through physical fitness include, but aren?t limited to:

    Sharper memory.
    Clarity in thinking.
    Higher self-esteem.
    Better sleep.
    Increased energy.
    Stronger resilience.
    Increased BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), which improves neurotransmission.

Counseling has, unfortunately, had a stigma attached. The medical model was developed to fix what was ?broken.? People receiving counseling are not broken. Human beings are malleable and can rewire themselves. A professional counselor can help with this plasticity by allowing the release of painful or unhelpful thoughts and behaviors.

 
Potential Benefits of Counseling:

    Improvement in communication and interpersonal skills.
    Greater self-acceptance.
    Increased self-esteem.
    Improved self-expression and management of emotions.
    Relief from depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions.
    Clarity.

Coaching is another area where practitioners can increase the benefits of mental health. While coaching is not therapy, it can be very therapeutic. Having a trained coach can create areas of growth that clear the way for massive personal improvement.

For more information, you can also read our post on the scientifically proven Benefits of Counseling.

 
Potential Benefits of Coaching:

    Learning acceptance and self-appreciation
    Improved connection with self and others
    Simplifying life
    Reduced stress
    Harmony and peace
    Increased self-awareness
    Reduction in isolation
    Improvements in relationships
    Improved communication
    Overcoming procrastination
    Gaining work and or life satisfaction
    Increased self-reliance
    Improved decision making
    Mindset shifts
    Increased self-worth
    Improved time management skills

 

A Look at the Research

Exercise may be one of the most underused treatments for improving mental health. Research has shown that patients suffering from depressive or anxiety sensitive disorders benefit significantly from increased exercise interventions (Smits, 2008).

The Center for Disease Control recommends 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity to reduce the risk of premature death. Astonishingly, most of the population fails to come close to meeting the guidelines to improve their well being.

The research has not determined which type of exercise is the most beneficial for mental health. Aerobic exercise strengthens the cardiovascular system but also releases serotonin to improve mood. However, weight training and mind spirit practices like yoga show great benefits as well.

Journaling is a powerful tool used as an intervention in many different areas of well being. The benefits can be seen not only in mental, but also physical wellness. Research has shown improvement in breast cancer patient recovery through the use of journaling.

Adolescent use of reflective journaling has shown increases in self-efficacy, self-regulation, and self-motivation. Reflective journaling has also been used to the great benefit of those working to overcome addiction.

The use of a journal offers a space to release inner fears and stress as a reflective process. The reduction of stress and unwanted negative thoughts are benefits that are seen through consistent practice. Journaling has also been proven to improve critical thinking skills.

There is a limited amount of empirical research in the area of coaching. However, concerning men, coaching has had significant forward progress. Men tend to seek help less actively than women (McKelley, 2007) but are more likely to seek coaching due to the reduced stigma attached. While coaching is not therapy, it can benefit participants with clarity, perspective shifts, and improvements to motivation in all areas of life.

 

Most Interesting Scientific Findings

A fascinating study done on mice shows the benefits of exercise on the reduction of sensitivity to social defeat and stress (Lehmann, 2017). The study found the structures of the brain that have reduced function when facing chronic social defeat. Like humans, mice are sensitive to social interactions. The stress from the interactions that are defeating alter parts of the brain and can show up in humans as anxiety or depression.

Interestingly though, when the mice were introduced to regular exercise, their brains showed less reaction to the chronic social defeat and higher functionality in some regions of the brain. Chronic stress alters the brain. Exercise reduces sensitivity to that stress, allowing for the brain to function properly.

Another interesting study was done in Canada (Dwyer, 2013), illustrating the benefits of journaling as a counseling tool for women overcoming a gambling addiction. Participants from this study were instructed on effective journaling practice, in addition to group counseling. Less relapse and improved growth in areas of overcoming thoughts around the addiction were reported in the results.

A school intervention study (Zyromski, 2009) found reflective journaling promoted increased academic achievement and reduced instances of violence. This research was a qualitative analysis of student intervention targeting attitudes, behaviors, and peer relationships.

Results found that kids participating in the reflective activities of an online intervention changed the perception of peer relationships to improve interactions and requests for assistance.

Research in coaching, especially with chronic medical patients, has shown benefits in improved mental health. Accountability is huge! We all get bogged down in the day to day of life. A coach helps keep things on track and improves communication between doctors and patients (Leville, 2009). A reduction in chronic pain was reported in a study on the benefits of having a health coach when facing severe medical problems.

 

5 Things You Can Do To Realize These Benefits
1. Move your body

If more people knew the benefits of exercise on avoidance of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer?s Disease, more people would be running to join a local gym. Exercise helps increase ROS (reactive oxygen species), resulting in decreases in the incidence of oxidative stress-related diseases (Deslandes, 2009). All disease has links to inflammation.

Regular exercise increases the body?s ability to reduce that inflammation, therefore, slowing the aging process.

Start small and grow your exercise practice slowly and consistently. Jumping in with excessive weight training or aerobic exercise can be harmful and lessen the willingness to continue with the practice. A slow, steady increase in levels of activity is highly recommended. Nobody becomes The Rock overnight.

 
2. Counseling

When thoughts and feelings are interfering with your daily life, advice can be very helpful. Navigating trauma, depression, and anxiety, or other strains on mental health is complicated. Doing it alone makes it even more so. Reaching out for help from a professional doesn?t mean you?re weak; it means you?re ready to start getting stronger.

 
3. Coaching

People come to coaching for a variety of reasons. Coaches specialize their practices, just as counselors do, to best serve their clients. Seeking the services of a coach can help clients realize their power in their actions and generate motivation to move from A to B, while space is held by a trained professional.

 
4. Journaling

There are a million ways to start a journaling practice. Keeping track of thoughts, actions, and motivations can be very powerful when actively reflecting on personal change. It helps adults and children alike. It also shines a light on daily actions and whether one is being honest with oneself.

 
5. 12 Intentional Activities

Engaging in the activities that come most naturally to a practitioner are specific ways to improve mental health. The benefits are outlined in The How of Happiness by Sonja Lyubmorisky. The ?how? is always an individual approach but highly beneficial when intentionally focused.

    Savor life
    Nurture social relationships
    Express gratitude
    Commit to your goals
    Create coping strategies
    Practice acts of kindness
    Engage in flow experiences
    Cultivate optimism
    Practice spirituality
    Take care of your mind and body
    Learn to forgive
    Avoid over-thinking and social comparison

 

A Take-Home Message

The first step in realizing the benefits of mental health is recognizing the need for improvement. We all have work to do. There is no human (not even the Dalai Lama) who can say that they have achieved perfection in mental health. All humans face adversity, yet our ability to handle that adversity can grow like a muscle.

The benefits of mental health far outweigh the effort it takes to begin a practice for improvement. Whether it?s grabbing a friend to start a walking practice, or heading off to the store to pick out a notebook to start your journaling practice, you can begin today. We are all one decision away from the many benefits of mental health.

"Mental health providers: Tips on finding one

Mental health providers: Credentials, services offered and what to expect
By Mayo Clinic Staff

If you've never seen a mental health provider before, you may not know how to find one who suits your specific needs. Here are some things to keep in mind as you search for a mental health provider.
What type of mental health provider do you need?

Mental health providers are professionals who diagnose mental health conditions and provide treatment. Most have at least a master's degree or more-advanced education, training and credentials. Be sure that the professional you choose is licensed to provide mental health services. Licensing and services depend on the provider's training, specialty area and state law.

Below you'll find some of the most common types of mental health providers. Some may specialize in certain areas, such as depression, substance misuse or family therapy. They may work in different settings, such as private practice, hospitals, community agencies or other facilities.
Psychiatrist

A psychiatrist is a physician ? doctor of medicine (M.D.) or doctor of osteopathic medicine (D.O.) ? who specializes in mental health. This type of doctor may further specialize in areas such as child and adolescent, geriatric, or addiction psychiatry. A psychiatrist can:

    Diagnose and treat mental health disorders
    Provide psychological counseling, also called psychotherapy
    Prescribe medication

Psychologist

A psychologist is trained in psychology ? a science that deals with thoughts, emotions and behaviors. Typically, a psychologist holds a doctoral degree (Ph.D., Psy.D., Ed.D.). A psychologist:

    Can diagnose and treat a number of mental health disorders, providing psychological counseling, in one-on-one or group settings
    Cannot prescribe medication unless he or she is licensed to do so
    May work with another provider who can prescribe medication if needed

Psychiatric-mental health nurse

A psychiatric-mental health nurse (P.M.H.N.) is a registered nurse with training in mental health issues. A psychiatric-mental health advanced practice registered nurse (P.M.H.-A.P.R.N.) has at least a master's degree in psychiatric-mental health nursing. Other types of advanced practice nurses who provide mental health services include a clinical nurse specialist (C.N.S.), a certified nurse practitioner (C.N.P) or a doctorate of nursing practice (D.N.P.).

Mental health nurses:

    Vary in the services they can offer, depending on their education, level of training, experience and state law
    Can assess, diagnose and treat mental illnesses, depending on their education, training and experience
    Can ? if state law allows ? prescribe medication if they're an advanced practice nurse

Physician assistant

A certified physician assistant (P.A.-C.) practices medicine as a primary care provider or in collaboration with a physician. Physician assistants can specialize in psychiatry. These physician assistants can:

    Diagnose and treat mental health disorders
    Counsel on diagnoses, treatments and prognosis, and provide education
    Prescribe medication

Licensed clinical social worker

If you prefer a social worker, look for a licensed clinical social worker (L.C.S.W.) or a licensed independent clinical social worker (L.I.C.S.W.) with training and experience specifically in mental health. A licensed clinical social worker must have a master's degree in social work (M.S.W.) and some have a doctorate in social work (D.S.W. or Ph.D.). These social workers:

    Provide assessment, diagnosis, counseling and a range of other services, depending on their licensing and training
    Are not licensed to prescribe medication
    May work with another provider who can prescribe medication if needed

Licensed professional counselor

Training required for a licensed professional counselor (L.P.C.), licensed clinical professional counselor (L.C.P.C.) or similar titles may vary by state, but most have at least a master's degree with clinical experience. These licensed counselors:

    Provide diagnosis and counseling for a range of concerns
    Are not licensed to prescribe medication
    May work with another provider who can prescribe medication if needed

What factors should you consider?

Consider these factors when choosing among the various types of mental health providers:

    Your concern or condition. Most mental health providers treat a range of conditions, but one with a specialized focus may be more suited to your needs. For example, if you have an eating disorder, you may need to see a psychologist who specializes in that area. If you're having marital problems, you may want to consult a licensed marriage and family therapist. In general, the more severe your symptoms or complex your diagnosis, the more expertise and training you need to look for in a mental health provider.
    Whether you need medications, counseling or both. Some mental health providers are not licensed to prescribe medications. So your choice may depend, in part, on your concern and the severity of your symptoms. You may need to see more than one mental health provider. For example, you may need to see a psychiatrist to manage your medications and a psychologist or another mental health provider for counseling.
    Your health insurance coverage. Your insurance policy may have a list of specific mental health providers who are covered or may only cover certain types of mental health providers. Check ahead of time with your insurance company, Medicare or Medicaid to find out what types of mental health services are covered and what your benefit limits are.

How can you find a mental health provider?

To find a mental health provider, you have several options:

    Ask your health insurance company for a list of covered providers. Many insurance companies make a list of providers they cover available on the internet.
    Seek a referral or recommendation from your primary care provider.
    Ask trusted friends, family or clergy.
    Check to see whether your company's employee assistance program (EAP) or student health center offers mental health services, or ask for a referral.
    Contact a local or national mental health organization by phone or on the internet, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).
    Search the internet for professional associations that have directories of mental health providers, such as the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association or the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies.
    Check phone book listings or search the internet under categories such as community service numbers, counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists or social service organizations.

What should you look for in a mental health provider?

When choosing a mental health provider, consider these issues:

    Education, training, licensing and years in practice ? licensing requirements vary widely by state
    Areas they specialize in and specific services they offer
    Treatment approaches and philosophy
    Which insurance providers they work with
    Office hours, fees and length of sessions

Don't hesitate to ask lots of questions. Finding the right match is crucial to establishing a good relationship and getting the most out of your treatment.","https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/in-depth/mental-health-providers/art-20045530","mental health services benefits","google",NA,NA

You Called a Mental Health Professional...Now What?

Spend a few minutes talking with him or her on the phone; ask about their approach to working with patients, their philosophy, whether or not they have a specialty or concentration. If you feel comfortable talking to the counselor or doctor, the next step is to make an appointment.

On your first visit, the therapist or doctor will want to get to know you and why you called him or her. The therapist will want to know?what you think the problem is; about your life; what you do; where you live and with whom you live. It is also common to be asked about your family and friends. This information helps the professional to assess your situation and develop a plan for treatment.

As you progress through the therapeutic process, you should begin to feel gradual relief from your distress, to develop self-assurance and have a greater ability to make decisions and increased comfort in your relationship with others. Therapy may be painful and uncomfortable at times but episodes of discomfort occur during the most successful therapy sessions. Mental health treatment should help you cope with your feelings more effectively.

The following are a few common types of therapy:

    Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has two main aspects. The cognitive part works to develop helpful beliefs about your life. The behavioral side helps you learn to take healthier actions.
    Interpersonal therapy focuses largely on improving relationships and helping a person express emotions in healthy ways.
    Family therapy helps family members communicate, handle conflicts and solve problems better.
    Psychodynamic therapy helps people develop a better understanding about their unconscious emotions and motivations that can affect their thoughts and actions.
    Art therapy can include using music, dance, drawing and other art forms to help express emotions and promote healing.
    Psychoeducation helps people understand mental health conditions and ways to promote recovery.

A mental health counselor is a professional who utilizes a variety of psychotherapy methods and techniques to help people experiencing psychological distress. In the United States, about one in four adults are experiencing mental illness at any given time, and research shows that close to 50% of adults will have at least one mental illness during their lifetime.1? The prevalence of mental health problems highlights the demand and need for qualified professionals to diagnose, treat, and prevent mental health issues.

The societal costs of mental health issues are growing increasingly high as well. Studies show that the economic burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is around $210.5 billion a year.2?

If you are curious about what a mental health counselor can do for you or thinking about entering this profession yourself, there are a few important things you should know. Learn more about what these professionals do, when you might want to consider seeing one, and what you need to do if you are interested in becoming a mental health counselor.
Where Can You Find Mental Health Counselors?

All people face different psychological challenges at various points in life, and sometimes people need the help of a professional to cope with these difficulties. It can sometimes be confusing to determine what type of help is needed, particularly because there are so many different types of professionals who specialize in treating mental health issues.

Mental health counselors represent just one profession that specifically works with people dealing with cognitive, behavioral, and emotional issues. Counselors work with individuals, families, groups, and communities to deal with mental health issues and improve mental well-being.

You might find professional mental health counselors working in a wide range of settings including:

    Mental health clinics
    Schools
    Private practices
    Hospitals
    Community health centers
    Correctional facilities
    Businesses
    Colleges and universities
    Social service agencies
    Government agencies

People experiencing symptoms of psychological illnesses such as depression, phobias, and anxiety may choose to see a mental health counselor for counseling and psychotherapy services. Counselors may also help people experiencing social difficulties, emotional problems, addictions and substance abuse, grief, self-esteem issues, and marital difficulties. Some mental health counselors choose to work with specific populations such as children, the elderly, or college students.
What Do Mental Health Counselors Do?

Some of the tasks that a mental health counselor may tackle on a regular basis include:

    Assessing and diagnosing clients experiencing symptoms of psychological distress
    Providing psychotherapy to clients
    Talking to clients about their experiences, emotions, and thoughts
    Conducting group sessions with families
    Working with clients to set goals, develop a treatment plan, and gain insight through treatment
    Working with clients to identify situations, behaviors, and thoughts that interfere with their wellness and recovery
    Examining social issues that may influence a client's mental well-being, including peer pressure, bullying, substance use, prejudice, work stress, financial challenges, and health issues
    Referring clients to other health professionals as well as to other resources in the community such as other social services, job services, and support groups

Counseling tends to view individual needs within a humanistic context. Rather than focusing on dysfunction, counselors often see problems as arising from normal reactions to developmental changes or as difficulty dealing with specific life stages. As a result, counselors may focus on personal development by helping you learn the skills and coping abilities you need to deal with such life changes and stages effectively.

While counselors are often called upon to treat specific problems, they also tend to take an approach that focuses on overall wellness. Dealing with the immediate problem is important, but counselors also strive to help you function not just minimally, but optimally. Enhancing overall well-being by solving problems, improving resilience, encouraging healthy behaviors, and improving relationships is a key component of a counselor's duties.
What Training Do Mental Health Counselors Have?

What type of training do mental health counselors need? Many begin by earning a bachelor's degree in a human services field such as psychology, sociology, or social work. While having a background in social science is ideal, people with undergraduate degrees in other fields can also enter the field of counseling. This often requires completing a number of basic prerequisite courses before gaining admission to an accredited master's degree program.
Basic Educational Requirements

The minimum requirements for a licensed mental health counselor are a master's degree in counseling and at least two to three years of supervised practice under a licensed professional.3?
Licensing and Certification

States typically require a minimum of 2,000 to 3,000 hours of supervised practice before gaining licensure; however, it is important to check with your state's licensing board to learn more about specific requirements. Always be sure to check the guidelines in the state where you plan to study and practice.

Once this has been done, aspiring mental health counselors must still pass a state licensing exam. In many states, counselors must first pass a test administered by the National Board of Certified Counselors (NBCC) in order to obtain a license.

Licensing requirements for mental health counselors vary from state to state, and specific titles for these professional designations may vary as well. Mental health counselors may be known as a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC), Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor of Mental Health (LPCC), or Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC). In most states, the title of ""Mental Health Counselor"" is a protected title, which means that only people who have met certain state requirements may legally call themselves by that title.

In addition to these basic education and licensure requirements, some counselors also choose to become certified. While this certification is purely voluntary, it is an additional qualification that can make professional counselors more appealing to both employers and potential clients.3?
Continuing Education

Even after finishing licensure requirements, counselors must continue to stay abreast of current practices by completing a number of continuing education courses over the course of their professional lives. While this means that you will need to continue taking courses throughout your career, it also allows you to stay current and explore new information and techniques to better hone your skills as a counselor.
Skills That Mental Health Counselors Need

Aside from training and education, what type of skills should you have in order to succeed in this profession? Becoming an effective mental health counselor requires a solid knowledge base of psychology, therapy, and counseling. In addition to understanding this subject matter and techniques, counselors need to have good listening skills, the ability to communicate effectively, good critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and outstanding people skills. Emotional intelligence, compassion, empathy, and nonverbal communication abilities are also critical.

If you are interested in becoming a mental health counselor, it is important to consider both the potential benefits of the career as well as some of the possible drawbacks. One of the greatest rewards of being a mental health counselor is being able to have a direct impact on the lives and well-being of clients. Counseling allows professionals to both prevent and treat psychological distress, which can help clients lead healthier and happier lives.

One potential downside to consider is the fact that the job can sometimes be stressful since counselors sometimes need to intervene and assist clients who may be emotional, angry, or even combative. Good stress management and emotional regulation abilities can be important in maintaining a good balance in your life as you juggle the rigors of your job and other life responsibilities and goals.
How Much Do Mental Health Counselors Earn?

The Occupational Outlook Handbook reports that substance abuse, behavioral disorder, and mental health counselors held nearly 304,500 jobs in 2018, with the largest percentage working in outpatient mental health and substance abuse centers. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for a mental health counselor was $44,630 in 2018.

Individual salaries can vary depending upon a wide range of factors, including geographic location and area of practice, with the top 10% earning an annual wage of more than $72,990 and the bottom 10% earning less than $28,240.

Areas that had the highest rates of employment included outpatient mental health and substance abuse centers, Individual and family services, and hospitals (state, local, and private).

The highest-paying areas of employment for mental health counselors include government positions ($51,690), hospitals ($48,310), and individual and family services ($44,120).4?

While mental health counselors typically earn less than psychologists, this is also a factor that makes them appealing to insurers. Mental health counselors are able to receive third-party reimbursement for the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of psychological conditions,5? often at a less expensive rate than some other health professionals.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the demand for mental health counselors will grow at a rate faster than the average for all occupations. They suggest that the demand for substance abuse, behavioral disorder, and mental health counselors will grow by 22% by 2028. This need for mental health counselors will be particularly strong in fields that deal with substance abuse and serve military veterans.4?
Reasons You Might Want to See a Mental Health Counselor

People often face mental health challenges throughout life. Such struggles can include anxiety, depression, grief, addiction, and difficulty in coping with life's stresses and challenges. Some of the reasons you might want to seek the assistance of a mental health counselor:

    You are experiencing repeated, uncontrollable thoughts or memories related to a recent traumatic experience.
    Life seems intense and unmanageable.
    You feel uninterested in things you used to enjoy and disconnected from the people around you.
    You have been using substances to cope with your problems.
    Your anxiety feels overwhelming.
    Your relationships feel strained and not what they used to be.
    You just feel like you would benefit from talking about your concerns with a professional.

Remember, you don't need to be experiencing symptoms of a psychological disorder to seek help from a mental health professional. Counselors, as well as other mental health professionals, can help you with a wide range of concerns, from stress to health to relationships. Whether your goal is to gain insight into your own behaviors, become a better spouse or parent, or become more motivated to achieve your goals, consulting a mental health professional can help.

If you are looking for a counselor, you can use the resources provided by the National Board of Certified Counselors to locate certified counselors in your area. You can also discuss your symptoms and needs with your primary care physician who can then refer you to a mental health counselor, psychologist, or psychiatrist.
A Word From Verywell

Mental health counselors play a vital role in the delivery of psychological services. If you feel that you might benefit from counseling, talk to your doctor to learn more about your options and if a mental health counselor might be the right fit for your needs.

If you are interested in a career in this field, spend some time researching what you will need to do in order to become a counselor. Mental health counseling is just one career option in this area, and you might want to consider related careers such social worker, clinical psychologist, marriage and family therapist, or counseling psychologist.","https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-mental-health-counselor-4157925","mental health services benefits","google",NA,NA

Chiropractic Care for Back Pain

    What Is Chiropractic Care?
    What Does Chiropractic Treatment for Back Pain Involve?
    What Are the Benefits and Risks of Chiropractic Care?

Among people seeking back pain relief alternatives, most choose chiropractic treatment. About 22 million Americans visit chiropractors annually. Of these, 7.7 million, or 35%, are seeking relief from back pain from various causes, including accidents, sports injuries, and muscle strains. Other complaints include pain in the neck, arms, and legs, and headaches.
What Is Chiropractic Care?

Chiropractors use hands-on spinal manipulation and other alternative treatments. The theory is that proper alignment of the body's musculoskeletal structure, particularly the spine, will enable the body to heal itself without surgery or medication. Manipulation is used to restore mobility to joints restricted by tissue injury caused by a traumatic event, such as falling, or repetitive stress, such as sitting without proper back support.

Chiropractic treatment is primarily used as a pain relief alternative for muscles, joints, bones, and connective tissue, such as cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. It is sometimes used in conjunction with conventional medical treatment.

What Does Chiropractic Treatment for Back Pain Involve?

A chiropractor first takes a medical history, performs a physical examination, and may use lab tests or diagnostic imaging to determine if treatment is appropriate for your back pain.

The treatment plan may involve one or more manual adjustments in which the doctor manipulates the joints, using a controlled, sudden force to improve range and quality of motion. Many chiropractors also incorporate nutritional counseling and exercise/rehabilitation into the treatment plan. The goals of chiropractic care include the restoration of function and prevention of injury in addition to back pain relief.
What Are the Benefits and Risks of Chiropractic Care?

Spinal manipulation and chiropractic care are generally considered safe, effective treatments for acute low back pain, the type of sudden injury that results from moving furniture or getting tackled. Acute back pain, which is more common than chronic pain, lasts no more than six weeks and typically gets better on its own.

Research has also shown chiropractic care to be helpful in treating neck pain and headaches. In addition, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia may respond to the moderate pressure used both by chiropractors and practitioners of deep tissue massage.","https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/chiropractic-pain-relief#1","chiropractic benefits","google",NA,NA

Studies have not confirmed the effectiveness of prolotherapy or sclerotherapy for pain relief, used by some chiropractors, osteopaths, and medical doctors, to treat chronic back pain, the type of pain that may come on suddenly or gradually and lasts more than three months. The therapy involves injections such as sugar water or anesthetic in hopes of strengthening the ligaments in the back.

People who have osteoporosis, spinal cord compression, or inflammatory arthritis, or who take blood-thinning medications should not undergo spinal manipulation. In addition, patients with a history of cancer should first obtain clearance from their medical doctor before undergoing spinal manipulation.

All treatment is based on an accurate diagnosis of your back pain. The chiropractor should be well informed regarding your medical history, including ongoing medical conditions, current medications, traumatic/surgical history, and lifestyle factors. Although rare, there have been cases in which treatment worsened a herniated or slipped disc, or neck manipulation resulted in a spinal cord injury. To be safe, always check with your medical doctor to make sure your condition will benefit from chiropractic or other pain relief alternatives."

Every year, millions of people in the U.S. see chiropractors for relief of headaches; back, shoulder, foot and neck pain. People also seek help with numbness and tingling or a loss of strength in the arms, hands and legs.

Overall, 62% of adults in the U.S. have had neck or back pain significant enough that they sought treatment from a health care professional at some point in their lifetime, according to the 2018 Gallup-Palmer College of Chiropractic Annual Report. Among patients who sought health care for neck or back pain, 63% saw a medical doctor and 53% sought treatment from a chiropractor, the survey found.

The estimated number of people who seek chiropractic care is in the tens of millions. A previous Gallup survey conducted on behalf of the Palmer College of Chiropractic, based in Davenport, Iowa, found that more than 62 million people have seen a chiropractor since 2011.

The number of adults in the U.S. who seek chiropractic care has remained stable since 2007, according to the National Health Interview Survey, which was released by the federal government in September 2017.

Chiropractors tout their treatment as the least invasive and safest therapy for many ailments. But chiropractic treatment is not without risk.

Here's a closer look at some of the advantages of chiropractic treatment, what some doctors say are potential downsides and suggestions for how to obtain the best care.
[ 

See: 11 Ways to Cope With Back Pain. ]
What Chiropractors Do

Chiropractors treat people by aligning their spine with a variety of manipulations.

During the first visit, chiropractors typically perform a physical exam and take a health history, paying special attention to the spine and whether the patient has normal bone density.

People with lower levels of bone density, such as patients with osteoporosis, would receive gentler treatments. The chiropractor typically uses his or her hands to apply controlled, rapid force to a damaged or injured joint, to allow the joint to move in a normal manner and reduce pain and inflammation, says Ray Tuck, a chiropractor in Blacksburg, Virginia, and a past chairman of the board of the American Chiropractic Association. Tuck is president and chief executive officer of Tuck Chiropractic Clinic. Last July, the Unified Virginia Chiropractic Association announced that Tuck had been elected president of the Virginia Board of Medicine.

One common maneuver is the high-velocity cervical adjustment, in which the patient relaxes his or her head in the hands of the chiropractor, who quickly thrusts the head in one direction ? sometimes creating a cracking sound. Chiropractors can also conduct gentler, low-velocity cervical adjustments.

Chiropractors also treat some patients for headaches that are caused by nerve irritation that refers pain to the head, Tuck says. Treatment can alleviate these headaches by reducing nerve irritation.
Benefits

Some research suggests that chiropractic care can be beneficial.

In a study published in Spine Journal in 2008, researchers evaluated the chiropractic treatment experiences of 192 people with back-related pain or sciatica, a condition in which a pinched nerve in the lower spine causes leg pain. The treatment they received for pain was rated worthwhile by 87% of the participants.

Another study published in the British Medical Journal in 2003 evaluated 183 patients with neck pain who were randomly assigned to receive treatment that involved either spinal manipulations, physiotherapy (mainly exercise) or care from a general practitioner, which involved primarily counseling, education and prescription drugs. The people in the study kept cost diaries for one year. The study found that spinal manipulations were more effective and less costly than physiotherapy or care by a general practitioner.

Risks

Chiropractors tout their treatment as the least invasive and safest therapy for many ailments. But chiropractic treatment is not without risk.





""Like any other medical specialists, all chiropractors are not created equal,"" says Dr. Vernon Williams, a sports neurologist director and founding director of the Center for Sports Neurology and Pain Medicine at Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles. ""I have worked with very good chiropractors who've done great work with my patients. I generally avoid forced manipulations of the neck, as there is risk of injury to blood vessels.""

Williams says he prefers chiropractic manipulations be combined with active strengthening and stabilization exercises when appropriate. ""Finally, if there are significant neurological signs or symptoms or structural abnormalities on imaging, I recommend medical evaluation and management,"" Williams says.
[ 

See: Questions to Ask a Pain Management Doctor. ]
Safety

The American Chiropractic Association says neck manipulation procedures are quite safe. Todd Sinett, a chiropractor in New York City and author of the book ""3 Weeks To A Better Back,"" says he has conducted cervical manipulations for more than 20 years without adverse effects to his patients.

""Is chiropractic manipulation safe? The answer is a resounding yes,"" he says. ""Is it without its risks? The answer is no.""

""I'm not saying that cervical adjustment is not without risks,"" Sinett says. ""But if you are comparing the risks to those of negative drug interactions, such as allergies, and the risks of surgery, chiropractic is safer.""

Sinett pointed to a 1996 study by the Rand Corporation, a nonprofit research group based in Santa Monica, California, that found the risk of an adverse effect from a cervical manipulation at less than one per 1 million treatments. A 2001 study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found the risk of a stroke following a cervical chiropractic treatment to be one per 5.85 million treatments.

""When considering any medical treatment or even considering taking any medications you want to weigh the risks and rewards,"" he says. ""Much has been made in public about the dangers of cervical manipulation. However, statistically speaking, cervical manipulation is quite safe.""
What to Look for in a Chiropractor

Experts recommend you take these steps if you're considering seeking chiropractic care for the first time:

    Get a referral from a doctor, relative or trusted friend.
    Know that some doctors recommend that patients avoid neck manipulations.
    Be aware of symptoms that may require a trip to an emergency department.
    Consider seeing an osteopath instead.

Get a referral from a doctor, relative or trusted friend. Read the chiropractor's website, including patient reviews. Meet with the chiropractor to discuss his or her treatment approach for the patient's specific condition, Overland says. Ask about the various types of treatment the chiropractor provides and the benefits and potential risks of different treatments.

Currently, chiropractors are licensed to practice in all 50 states. However, many chiropractors, like other health care providers, have post-graduate certifications. Ask your chiropractor if he or she has any post-graduate certifications or a specialty. For example, Overland specializes in sports medicine. Other chiropractors may have a specialty in nutrition or physical rehabilitation.

What Does One FDA Approval Mean for Patients Diagnosed with...
New approval offers a much needed treatment option for people with these devastating lung diseases.","https://health.usnews.com/wellness/articles/should-i-go-to-a-chiropractor","chiropractic benefits","google",NA,"A 2010 study published in Medscape reviewed more than two dozen published deaths after chiropractic treatments, noting that other deaths may have been unreported. The study said that a separate 1997 review of complications after neck manipulations included 177 cases in which the patient was injured. In 32 instances, the injury was fatal. The vast majority of these cases were associated with chiropractic treatment, the study concluded.

It's important for consumers to keep in mind that such deaths are rare, given that millions of people undergo chiropractic care annually, says Keith Overland, a past president of the ACA and a chiropractor in Norwalk, Connecticut. ""It's important for the consumer to compare risks of all potential treatments and consider which are the safest and most effective,"" he says. ""Chiropractic is among the most conservative treatments for many musculoskeletal conditions. It's been shown to have among the lowest rates of adverse effects and risks compared to other treatments."" A high-profile death associated with chiropractic care occurred in October 2016. That month, the Los Angeles County Coroner's office ruled that the mysterious death of Playboy model Katie May was attributable to a stroke caused by an artery that was ruptured during a chiropractic treatment, specifically, a neck manipulation. May, 34, died in February of that year after she went to a chiropractor for treatment following a fall.

In 2014 the American Heart Association released a scientific statement saying getting your neck adjusted by a chiropractor or osteopathic doctor may be linked to an increased risk of stroke.

While chiropractors say the risks of injury from chiropractic care are exceedingly low, even low risks are unacceptable, some physicians say, adding that they would advise patients to stay away from high-velocity neck manipulations. Know that some doctors recommend that patients avoid neck manipulations. Some physicians will advise their patients to avoid neck manipulations because of the risk they can rupture an artery, which can lead to a stroke.

Be aware of symptoms that may require a trip to an emergency department. Many patients seek chiropractic work for headaches. However, if someone has a severe headache that developed quickly, as well as odd sensations in their face, those could be possible symptoms of the early onset of a stroke, Tuck says.

In such cases, a trip to an emergency department may be the best option. ""Many of these symptoms could mean someone is a great candidate for chiropractic care,"" he says. ""But it's my job to get the patient to the right place, whether it's the emergency room, their family doctor or some other specialist.""

Consider seeing an osteopath. Osteopaths can manipulate the neck without risk of a serious injury, says Dr. David Borenstein, director of the New York Stem Cell Treatment Center in New York City. Unlike chiropractors, osteopaths are fully licensed physicians who can practice in all areas of medicine. Osteopaths can prescribe medication, can do injections and also perform spinal manipulations. They receive special training in the musculoskeletal system, which connects the body's system of nerves, muscle and bones. During their medical training, osteopaths spend time in operating rooms and intensive care units, which gives them additional training over what chiropractors receive, Borenstein says."

The Many Benefits of Chinese Cupping

?Acupuncture and cupping, more than half of the ills cured,? is a famous Chinese saying, supporting traditional Chinese medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine brings to mind acupuncture and the use of natural herbs as healing remedies. Cupping is a lesser-known treatment that is also part of Oriental medicine, one that can provide an especially pleasant experience. One of the earliest documentations of cupping can be found in the work titled A Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies, which was written by a Taoist herbalist by the name of Ge Hong and which dates all the way back to 300 AD. An even earlier Chinese documentation, three thousand years old, recommended cupping for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. In both Eastern and Western cultures, cupping evolved from shamanistic practices that held the belief that illnesses and infirmities can be sucked out of the body. This article details some of the many benefits of Chinese cupping for your body.

Cupping was established as an official therapeutic practice in the 1950s across hospitals in China after research conducted by Chinese and former Soviet Union acupuncturists confirmed cupping?s effectiveness. Prior to the 1950s, cupping had also been practiced as an auxiliary method in traditional Chinese surgery. In recent years cupping has been growing in popularity, with celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston, David Arquette, and athlete Michael Phelps drawing public attention to the traditional benefits of Chinese cupping therapy techniques.

Though news outlets were quick to criticize celebrities chasing the newest medical therapies and techniques, recent studies have shown cupping?s effectiveness in reducing pain intensity and providing positive short-term benefits.
What Is Chinese Cupping? What Does it Do for You?

Cupping is the term applied to a technique that uses small glass cups or bamboo jars as suction devices that are placed on the ski to disperse and break up stagnation and congestion by drawing congested blood, energy or other humors to the surface. In dry cupping, the therapist will simply place the suction cups on the skin. In wet cupping, the practitioner will make a small incision on the skin and then apply the suction cup to draw out small amounts of blood.

There are several ways that a practitioner can create the suction in the cups. One method involves swabbing rubbing alcohol onto the bottom of the cup, then lighting it and putting the cup immediately against the skin. Suction can also be created by placing an inverted cup over a small flame, or by using an alcohol-soaked cotton pad over an insulating material (like leather) to protect the skin, then lighting the pad and placing an empty cup over the flame to extinguish it. Flames are never used near the skin and are not lit throughout the process of cupping, but rather are a means to create the heat that causes the suction within the small cups.

Once the suction has occurred, the cups can be gently moved across the skin (often referred to as ?gliding cupping). Medical massage oils are sometimes applied to improve movement of the glass cups along the skin. The suction in the cups causes the skin and superficial muscle layer to be lightly drawn into the cup. Cupping is much like the inverse of massage ? rather than applying pressure to muscles, it uses gentle pressure to pull them upward. For most patients, this is a particularly relaxing and relieving sensation. Once suctioned, the cups are generally left in place for about ten minutes while the patient relaxes. This is similar to the practice of Tui Na, a traditional Chinese medicine massage technique that targets acupuncture points as well as painful body parts, and is well known to provide relief through pressure.

The side effects of cupping are fairly mild. Bruising should be expected, but skin should return to looking normal within 10 days. Other potential side effects include mild discomfort, skin infection, or burns. However, a trained health professional will apply an antibiotic ointment and bandage to prevent an infection.
The Philosophy Behind Pain and Cupping. What is Cupping Used For?

?Where there?s stagnation, there will be pain. Remove the stagnation, and you remove the pain.?

The old Chinese medical maxim holds that pain results from the congestion, stagnation, and blockage of Qi, or vital energy, vital fluids, lymph, phlegm, and blood. If pain is the essence of disease, then suffering is a result of obstructed or irregular flow in the body. Chinese cupping is therefore a method of breaking up the blockage to restore the body?s natural flow of energy.

Cupping Combined With Acupuncture

Generally, cupping is combined with acupuncture in one treatment, but it can also be used alone. The suction and negative pressure provided by cupping can loosen muscles, encourage blood flow, and sedate the nervous system (which makes it an excellent treatment for high blood pressure). Cupping is used to relieve back and neck pains, stiff muscles, anxiety, fatigue, migraines, rheumatism, and even cellulite. For weight loss and cellulite treatments, oil is first applied to the skin, and then the cups are moved up and down the surrounding area.

chinese cupping with acupuncture

Like acupuncture, cupping follows the lines of the meridians. There are five meridian lines on the back, and these are where the cups are usually placed. Using these points, cupping can help to align and relax qi, as well as target more specific maladies. By targeting the meridian channels, cupping strives to ?open? these channels ? the paths through which life energy flows freely throughout the body, through all tissues and organs, thus providing a smoother and more free-flowing qi (life force). Cupping is one of the best deep-tissue therapies available. It is thought to affect tissues up to four inches deep from the external skin. Toxins can be released, blockages can be cleared, and veins and arteries can be refreshed within these four inches of affected materials. Even hands, wrists, legs, and ankles can be ?cupped,? thus applying the healing to specific organs that correlate with these points.
More Benefits Of Chinese Cupping

More benefits of Chinese cupping for the lungs can clear congestion from a common cold or help to control a person?s asthma. In fact, respiratory conditions are one of the most common maladies that cupping is used to relieve.

Cupping?s detoxifying effect on skin and circulatory system is also significant, with a visible improvement in skin color after three to five treatments. Cupping removes toxins and improves blood flow through the veins and arteries. Especially useful for athletes is cupping?s potential to relieve muscle spasms.

Cupping also affects the digestive system. A few benefits include an improved metabolism, relief from constipation, a healthy appetite, and stronger digestion.

A 2015 report published in the Journal of Traditional and Complementary Medicine noted cupping as an effective alternative method of treating acne, pain, facial paralysis, cervical spondylosis, and herpes zoster.

As health practitioners and researchers continue to study the benefits of cupping, this traditional alternative care technique will gain further acceptance and wider practice across holistic healthcare centers in the U.S. as an effective treatment for a wide variety of ailments.","https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2014/09/20/many-benefits-chinese-cupping-1","cupping benefits","google",NA,NA

Cupping therapy is an ancient form of alternative medicine in which a therapist puts special cups on your skin for a few minutes to create suction. People get it for many purposes, including to help with pain, inflammation, blood flow, relaxation and well-being, and as a type of deep-tissue massage.

The cups may be made of:

    Glass
    Bamboo
    Earthenware
    Silicone

Cupping therapy might be trendy now, but it?s not new. It dates back to ancient Egyptian, Chinese, and Middle Eastern cultures. One of the oldest medical textbooks in the world, the Ebers Papyrus, describes how the ancient Egyptians used cupping therapy in 1,550 B.C.

During both types of cupping, your therapist will put a flammable substance such as alcohol, herbs, or paper in a cup and set it on fire. As the fire goes out, he puts the cup upside down on your skin.

As the air inside the cup cools, it creates a vacuum. This causes your skin to rise and redden as your blood vessels expand. The cup is generally left in place for up to 3 minutes.

A more modern version of cupping uses a rubber pump instead of fire to create the vacuum inside the cup. Sometimes therapists use silicone cups, which they can move from place to place on your skin for a massage-like effect.

Wet cupping creates a mild suction by leaving a cup in place for about 3 minutes. The therapist then removes the cup and uses a small scalpel to make light, tiny cuts on your skin. Next, he or she does a second suction to draw out a small quantity of blood.

You might get 3-5 cups in your first session. Or you might just try one to see how it goes. It?s rare to get more than 5-7 cups, the British Cupping Society notes.

Afterward, you may get an antibiotic ointment and bandage to prevent infection. Your skin should look normal again within 10 days.

Cupping therapy supporters believe that wet cupping removes harmful substances and toxins from the body to promote healing. But that?s not proven.

Some people also get ?needle cupping,? in which the therapist first inserts acupuncture needles and then puts cups over them.","https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/cupping-therapy#1","cupping benefits","google",NA,NA

What Does the Research Show?

There haven?t been many scientific studies on cupping.

One report, published in 2015 in the Journal of Traditional and Complementary Medicine, notes that it could help with acne, herpes zoster, and pain management.

That?s similar to the findings from a 2012 report, published in PLoS One. Australian and Chinese researchers reviewed 135 studies on cupping. They concluded that cupping therapy may be effective when people also get other treatments, like acupuncture or medications, for various diseases and conditions, such as:

    Herpes zoster
    Acne
    Facial paralysis
    Cervical spondylosis

But those researchers noted many of the studies they reviewed could have been biased and that better studies are needed.

    Migraines
    Anxiety and depression
    Bronchial congestion caused by allergies and asthma
    Varicose veins

There isn?t research to back all of that up.
Side Effects

Cupping is fairly safe, as long as you go to a trained health professional. But you could have these side effects in the area where the cups touch your skin:

    Mild discomfort
    Burns
    Bruises
    Skin infection

What to Ask Your Doctor First

Talk with your doctor before you start cupping or any other type of alternative or complementary medicine. And talk extensively with your cupping therapist, too, before you try it. Ask:

    What conditions do they use cupping for?
    What is your training?
    What is your experience in using it?
    Am I already getting the standard treatments for my condition?
    Are there reasons I should not get cupping?

Cupping is an ancient practice in traditional Chinese medicine that has been shown by Western research to have some real benefits.
Cupping is an ancient practice in traditional Chinese medicine that has been shown by Western research to have some real benefits.

Cupping is a therapy used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to remove stagnation and stimulate the flow of qi (chi). Qi is the free flow of vital energy circulating through the body and the world around us, if the qi is disrupted or disturbed, it can create stagnation (blockages) or imbalances in the body.
What is cupping in a massage?

A therapeutic cupping treatment involves warming and placing cups, usually made of glass, on the skin. By warming the air within the cup, a vacuum is created, and when it is applied to the skin, the tissue is drawn up into the cup. This increases the blood flow, loosens the fascia or connective tissue, and is thought to stimulate healing. It is similar to the way deep tissue massage can be used to break up scar tissue and reduce pain. The cups are often placed on the back, neck, and shoulders or the site of pain. Cupping may cause temporary bruising and soreness, depending upon the degree of suction created by the vacuum and the level of internal stagnation. According to TCM, this would be a favorable outcome, suggesting the treatment has successfully removed toxins and stagnation. The cups are removed by lifting one edge, which allows air in and breaks the seal and vacuum.
Cupping Side Effects
Bruises

A bruise is caused when tiny blood vessels are damaged or broken as the result of trauma to the skin (be it bumping against something or hitting yourself with a hammer). The raised area of a bump or bruise results from blood leaking from these injured blood vessels into the tissues as well as from the body's response to the injury. A bruise is medically referred to as a contusion. A purplish, flat bruise that occurs when blood leaks out into the top layers of skin is referred to as an ecchymosis.

What are the different types of cupping?

Different types of cupping are selected based on the treatment goals of the acupuncturist. There are also different types of cups. Most commonly, cups are made out of glass. However, a thousand years ago, cups were made of bamboo, clay, or animal horns. According to Ann Michelle Casco, L.Ac., a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner and acupuncturist, the classic cupping technique is called ba guan zi, which is fire or dry cupping. This involves placing the cup over an ashi (painful area) point or an acupuncture point along an energy meridian. The cups are left in place anywhere from five to 20 minutes depending on the nature of the individual's condition. A general course of treatment involves four to six sessions in intervals starting from three- to 10-day gaps.

The sliding cups technique is traditionally performed on large muscle groups of the back to treat pain and muscle spasms. Massage oil is applied to the skin prior to the cups being placed, which allows the cups to glide easily over the surface of the skin.

With air cupping, an alternative to fire cupping, a handheld suction pump is used to remove air from the cups, creating the vacuum without heat. Some clinical research from China suggests this innovation in cupping technology is more comfortable for patients.

Wet cupping combines an acupuncture technique called bleeding with cupping. A lancet is used to prick the skin before the cup is applied, which encourages a small amount of blood to flow from the area. This treatment is thought to dispel internal toxins. TCM practitioners in China use this technique for ""cooling"" inflammatory conditions.

What does cupping therapy do?

TCM teaches that it is the stagnation of qi and blood that causes pain and disease. Cupping invigorates local circulation of qi and blood in the area being treated, resolving swelling, pain, and tension. By drawing impurities to the surface, it removes toxins. From a Western physiology perspective, cupping loosens connective tissue or fascia and stimulated blood flow to the surface. Cupping stimulates tissue relaxation and better cell-to-cell communication. The research of U.S. physiologist and acupuncturist Helene Langevin has documented cell-level changes using an ultrasound camera. She has demonstrated that techniques like cupping, acupuncture, and massage relax tissue and reduce markers of inflammation. Inflammatory cytokines (chemical messengers) are reduced, and cytokines that promote healing and relaxation are increased.

What are the benefits of cupping?

The benefits of cupping include local pain relief and muscle relaxation. Cupping improves overall health by removing the energy blockages that TCM practitioners identify as barriers to the flow of healthy energy or qi. For athletes, cupping may help increase blood flow to a particular muscle region or help reduce pain. Numerous athletes from the Olympics in Rio 2016 used cupping. This was easily seen by circular markings on some of the U.S. swim team members.

What specialists perform cupping?

Cupping is generally performed by practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine.

Cupping techniques are described and can be found in the textbooks of TCM from over 1,000 years ago. To find a practitioner skilled and licensed to provide cupping, look for an acupuncturist licensed by a national or state accrediting agency such as, the State of California Acupuncture Board or the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM). Practitioners with these certifications have had over 3,000 hours of training at a reputable school and passed examinations required for the safe and legal practice of acupuncture and cupping.

What are potential side effects of cupping?

    Readers Comments 9
    Share Your Story

Cupping frequently causes marks on the skin. This is due to bringing blood to the surface, similar to a bruise. For patients with bleeding disorders such as hemophilia or who are being treated with anticoagulants, cupping may not be the best treatment option. People with these conditions should discuss the pros and cons of treatment with their acupuncturist or doctor before receiving cupping. Cupping should not be performed on skin sites with active inflammation, burns, infection, or open wounds. Some discomfort can occur but should not be considered a side effect. Moderate, temporary discomfort is expected as stagnation is removed and connective tissue and muscles are loosened.

Practitioners (especially traditional Western health-care providers) need to be aware of cupping as a treatment modality. In children, the bruising and discolorations post-cupping can be mistaken as a sign of child abuse.

How long do cupping bruises last?

The bruises for cupping can last for a few days up to two weeks.

What exactly is cupping?

The 2016 summer Olympics had its share of exciting performances, upsets, and photo finishes. But for days after Michael Phelps?s first appearance at the games, it seemed all anyone could talk about was ?cupping.? It?s an ancient therapy that left multiple circular discolorations on his skin. During ?dry cupping,? suction is applied to the skin for several minutes; sometimes it is combined with massage, acupuncture, or other alternative therapies. (?Wet cupping? is similar except that blood is removed by making small cuts in the skin.)

Cupping is supposed to draw fluid into the area; the discoloration is due to broken blood vessels just beneath the skin, much like a bruise. Cupping has been popular in Egyptian, Chinese, and Middle Eastern cultures going back thousands of years, but increasing numbers of people worldwide have been adopting it. Celebrities and athletes have popularized it in the U.S. in recent years.
What is cupping supposed to do?

According to its advocates, cupping is supposed to promote healing and has been used extensively for sore muscles. But that?s only the beginning. Cupping has also been used for

    back and neck pain
    skin diseases such as acne and hives
    lowering cholesterol
    migraines
    knee arthritis
    improving immune function.

And there are many others. If cupping does help with these problems, it?s worth asking: how? From a biological perspective, it?s not clear how the application of suction and drawing blood into an area under the skin would provide all these benefits. A recent review of the treatment describes cupping as a treatment that can strengthen the body?s resistance, restore balance between positive and negative forces, remove disease-causing factors, and promote blood circulation. But exactly how is unclear.
Does cupping work?

A number of studies have examined this question, but unfortunately don?t seem to have  convincingly answered it. In fact, a 2015 review of the evidence found that cupping might provide some relief for chronic neck or back pain, but that the quality of the evidence was too limited to draw firm conclusions.

One problem is that it?s tough to perform a high-quality study on cupping. The best studies are ?blinded placebo-controlled trials? in which neither the patient nor the researcher knows which treatment (real or placebo) has been given to a study subject. When medications are studied, coming up with a placebo pill is not difficult; it can be much more difficult to create a convincing placebo comparator for cupping. In addition, pain can be a difficult thing to measure and the placebo effect ? improvement related to an expectation of benefit ? can be quite powerful.

Still, there have been studies comparing actual acupuncture with convincing but fake (or ?sham?) acupuncture.  Similar studies of cupping could be possible. And if cupping truly helped, you may not care if it?s due to the placebo effect.


If you want convincing evidence of effectiveness before trying a treatment, you may want to pass on cupping for now. But if you?d like to try something that?s safe and might help with certain aches and pains (and possibly other ailments), the main downsides seem to be the temporary skin discoloration and the cost ? I found estimates online of $30 to $80 per treatment. Some people have it only ?as needed? but others may have it monthly or even more often. Future research could prove that cupping is as good as the claims say it is ? but we?ll have to wait for the results of high-quality studies to know if it?s true.","https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-exactly-is-cupping-2016093010402","cupping benefits","google",NA,"Are there risks involved with cupping?

Most experts agree that cupping is safe. As long as those treated don?t mind the circular discolorations (which fade over a number of days or weeks), side effects tend to be limited to the pinch experienced during skin suction. It?s quite unusual that cupping causes any serious problems (though, rarely, skin infections have been reported).
So, what?s next?"

What Is Cupping Therapy?And Should You Try It?

Cupping is the wellness trend that just refuses to die.

Seriously?raise your hand if you thought cupping therapy would die down back in 2016 after Michael Phelps permanently exited the pool (it me).

No such luck: Two years later and celebs are still participating in the cupping trend (I see you, Kaley Cuoco and Busy Phillips).

But uh, what exactly is cupping?and what is it used for?
Alright, WTF is cupping?

Cupping is an ancient Chinese therapy that?s based on the belief that certain health problems can be caused by stagnant blood and a poor energy flow through your body.

To fix or prevent those health issues, cupping practitioners apply cups?typically glass or silicone?to your skin to create a pressure that sucks your skin inward, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine.
Advertisement - Continue Reading Below

Cupping practitioners usually place cups on a person's back?though face cupping is becoming *a thing* now too?where they'll either leave the cups in place, or slide them around using lotion or oil, per the NCCIM.

Either way, the pressure that the cups create draws blood to the affected area, increasing your blood flow overall, says Chiti Parikh, M.D., integrative medicine practitioner at the Weill Cornell Medicine Integrative Health and Wellbeing Center in New York City.

?That increased blood flow can relieve muscle tension, improve circulation, and reduce inflammation,"" says Parikh.
What's cupping even used for?

Generally, cupping is used to treat chronic pain?back pain and headaches, in particular, says Parikh. ?It?s all about getting rid of musculoskeletal pain, which is often a physical manifestation of chronic stress,? he adds.

More often than not, that chronic stress manifests in how you carry yourself. ?We?re often tensing our muscles when we?re stressed?especially when we?re hunched over our computers and our phones?and that muscle tension can result in physical pain, which is what cupping helps reduce,"" says Parikh.

What's Causing Your Chronic Back Pain?

Many people also claim that cupping can help with detoxification, but because ""detoxing"" really isn't a thing, what they mean is that they are relieving inflammation in the area, Parikh clarifies.

?When people are suffering from physical pain, that means that inflammation has increased locally in that area. Cupping, then, improves blood circulation in that area by attracting immune cells to that location to increase the repair and recovery process, so that the swelling can go down,? explains Parikh.

While there are studies that claim cupping therapy can help reduce chronic pain, like a 2016 study published in the journal Evidence Based Complementary Alternative Medicine, the research is still inconclusive.

That results of that study in particular, as well as many other studies regarding cupping, may also be due to the placebo effect (i.e., simply believing something is working).
So, can cupping reduce my stress?

Cupping may be helpful in treating the more physical manifestations of stress. But, as we all know, physical symptoms are only part of the full story.

That's why cupping works best when paired with acupuncture to help the mental side of stress, says Parikh. ?Acupuncture releases endorphins, and may be better able to help manage the root cause of your mental stress and anxiety in a more holistic way,"" she explains. ""That?s why the combo of cupping and acupuncture works really synergistically to manage your stress from all areas.""

Plus, while trying cupping on its own may help treat physical pain in more acute conditions, the best and most long-lasting relief comes when you go for the combo. ?The effect is simply more sustainable that way,? she concludes. ?Cupping is hardly ever recommended on its own.?
Should I try cupping or nah?

In short: It's probably not going to do any damage?and hey, it might even help that back pain that's been bugging you for weeks, so go ahead and give it a try.
Advertisement - Continue Reading Below

Something to keep in mind: Those cups are definitely going to leave big, hickey-like bruises on your skin that can last anywhere from a few days to two weeks?so if that's not something you're interested in, maybe steer clear.

(It should be noted, however, that the color of the mark varies from person to person and doesn't signify how well the cupping worked.)

You'll also want to steer clear of cupping if you?re on blood thinners, have trouble with bleeding or clotting, or you have an open wound, cautions Parikh. The same goes for those with very sensitive or thin skin, she adds. ?You should also avoid cupping on any areas where you have delicate skin, because it can cause tearing.""

If these restrictions do not apply to you and you want to give cupping a whirl, it?s important to find a good practitioner. Parikh says the best cupping practitioners are actually?you guessed it?acupuncturists.

?To find a good one in your area, I would recommend asking an integrative medicine doctor for a recommendation,"" says Parikh. ""If you don?t know one, your regular doctor will usually be able to refer you to a good one.""

    Bronchial congestion due to the cold or asthma

In traditional Chinese medicine, cupping is said to stimulate the flow of vital energy (also known as ""Qi"" or ""chi"") and blood, and to help correct any imbalances arising from illness or injury. It's sometimes combined with acupuncture and tuina, other therapies said to promote the flow of energy.
How Does Cupping Therapy Work?

To create the suction inside the cups, the practitioner may them by placing a flammable substance (such as herbs, alcohol, and/or paper) inside each cup and then igniting that substance. Next, the practitioner places the cup upside down on the body. During a typical cupping treatment, between three and seven cups are placed on the body.

Today, many practitioners use a manual or electric pump to create the vacuum, or use self-suctioning cupping sets. After the cups are in place, they are usually removed after five to ten minutes. (Practitioners may practice ""flash"" cupping, by quickly attaching then removing the cup repeatedly.)

Some practitioners apply massage oil or cream and then attach silicone cups, sliding them around the body rhythmically for a massage-like effect.

In a procedure known as ""wet cupping,"" the skin is punctured prior to treatment. This causes blood to flow out of the punctures during the cupping procedure, which is thought to clear toxins from the body.4?
Benefits

To date, there is a lack of high-quality scientific research to support the use of cupping to treat any health condition. For instance, a 2011 research review sized up seven trials testing cupping in people with pain (such as low back pain); results showed that most of the studies were of poor quality.4?

In another research review published in 2017, scientists analyzed 11 studies that tested the use of cupping by athletes. The review's authors concluded that no explicit recommendation could be made for or against the use of cupping in athletes and that further studies are needed. Some studies did show that cupping improved perceptions of pain and disability and had favorable effects on range of motion compared to no cupping.3?

Although cupping is sometimes recommended to increase flexibility in athletes, a small study published in the Journal of Sports Rehabilitation in 2018 found no change in hamstring flexibility after a seven-minute cupping session using four cups. Study participants were NCAA Division III college soccer players without symptoms.5?

You shouldn't use cupping in place of standard treatment for any medical condition.
Possible Side Effects

Cupping may cause pain, swelling, burns, dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, sweating, skin pigmentation, and/or nausea.4? Cupping also leaves round purple marks or circular bruises on the skin; these marks may begin to fade after several days but can remain for two to three weeks. Scars and burns have been known to occur after cupping.

Cupping shouldn't be done on areas where the skin is broken, irritated, or inflamed, or over arteries, veins, lymph nodes, eyes, orifices, or any fractures. Pregnant woman, children, older adults, and people with certain health conditions (such as cancer, organ failure, hemophilia, edema, blood disorders, and some types of heart disease) are among those who shouldn't have cupping. People taking blood-thinning medication also shouldn't try cupping.

Although rare, other reported adverse effects include blisters, acquired hemophilia A, thrombocytopenia, iron deficiency anemia, keloids, panniculitis, and skin pigmentation. Infection, scarring, and blood loss may occur with wet cupping.

The practitioner should follow standard infection control practices and safety precautions to protect against the transmission of diseases (such as hepatitis).
Bottom Line

After seeing high-profile athletes and celebrities sport the characteristic round purple marks, it may be tempting to try cupping, but there's currently a lack of research on cupping. If you're still thinking of trying it, be sure to consult your doctor before beginning treatment.","https://www.verywellhealth.com/cupping-for-pain-88933","cupping benefits","google",NA,NA
"What to know about cupping therapy

    Does it work?
    Pain relief
    Skin conditions
    Sports recovery
    Side effects and risks
    Takeaway

There is some evidence to suggest that cupping therapy may be beneficial for certain health conditions. However, research into cupping therapy tends to be low-quality. More studies are necessary to understand how cupping therapy works, if it works, and in what situations it may help.

Cupping therapy is a traditional Chinese and Middle Eastern practice that people use to treat a variety of conditions.

It involves placing cups at certain points on a person?s skin. A practitioner creates suction in the cups, which pulls against a person?s skin.

Cupping can either be dry or wet. Wet cupping involves puncturing the skin before starting the suction, which removes some of the person?s blood during the procedure.

Cupping typically leaves round bruises on a person?s skin, where their blood vessels burst after exposure to the procedure?s suction effects.
Does it work?
Cupping therapy may help increase or decrease blood flow.

According to a study paper in the journal PLoS One, cupping practitioners claim that it works by creating hyperemia or hemostasis around a person?s skin. This means that it either increases or decreases a person?s blood flow under the cups.

Cupping also has links to acupoints on a person?s body, which are central to the practice of acupuncture.

Many doctors consider cupping therapy a complementary therapy, which means that many do not recognize it as part of Western medicine. This does not mean that it is not effective, however.

Complementary therapies with supporting research may be an addition to Western medicine. However, as the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) note, there is not yet enough high-quality research to prove cupping?s effectiveness.

Scientists have linked cupping therapy with a variety of health benefits, although there needs to be more research to determine whether it is effective as a treatment.
Pain relief

People frequently cite cupping therapy as a form of pain relief. However, while there is some evidence for its effectiveness, scientists need to conduct more high-quality studies to demonstrate this fully.

For example, a study paper in the journal Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine found some evidence to suggest that cupping may reduce pain. However, its authors note that there were limits to the quality of the studies that showed this.

A meta-analysis that appears in the journal Revista Latina-Americano De Enfermagem claims that there may be evidence for cupping being effective in treating back pain. However, again, the researchers note that most studies were low-quality, and that there is a need for more standardization in future studies.

One study paper in the journal BMJ Open came to a similar conclusion for the effectiveness of cupping for neck pain. The researchers note that there is a need for better-quality studies to determine whether cupping therapy is truly effective.

Skin conditions

A study paper in the journal PLoS One found that there was some evidence for cupping therapy being effective at treating herpes zoster and acne.

However, it notes that the studies that supported these findings were at a high risk of bias. So, more rigorous, high-quality studies are necessary to verify the findings.
Sports recovery

A study paper in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine notes that professional athletes are increasingly using cupping therapy as part of their recovery practices.

However, the study found no consistent evidence to show that it was effective for anything related to sports recovery.


To understand whether cupping therapy is effective, how it works, and what issues it is best for, scientists need to conduct and publish more high-quality research.

If a person finds that cupping therapy relieves their pain or helps their health in another way, and if they do not experience any adverse side effects, cupping may be a very good choice. However, some therapies have better evidence for their effectiveness. Doctors may advise that people consider these first.

A person may choose to use cupping therapy alongside better-evidenced therapies. If this is the case, it is important that they let a medical professional know.","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324817#takeaway","cupping benefits","google","
If a person has a skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis, cupping may make it worse on the area where the practitioner applies the cups.

In rare instances, a person may experience more significant internal bleeding or anemia if the practitioner takes too much blood during wet cupping.","Side effects and risks
Cupping can cause irritation or damage to the skin.

According to the NCCIH, the side effects of cupping can include:

    lasting skin discoloration
    scarring
    burns
    infection

According to a study paper that appears in the Journal of Acupuncture and Meridian Studies, cupping can also cause:

    headaches
    tiredness
    dizziness
    fainting
    nausea
    insomnia

Due to the poor quality of studies investigating cupping, it is difficult to know how common these side effects are.

If a person has any of these side effects following cupping therapy, they should speak to a medical professional. Some people may have health conditions, such as problems with blood clotting, that making cupping less than ideal.
Takeaway

There is some evidence to suggest that cupping therapy may be able to help a person with certain health issues. However, there are not enough high-quality studies to support this."

How do you relieve stress? Yoga? Massage? A pint of ice cream? Whatever you do to cope with a crazy work week or the hectic schedule of being a mom, you might consider cupping. It?s been around for thousands of years, but it gained newfound popularity with amateur and professional athletes.

What is it and how can it improve your health?

Chinese medicine practitioners have been using cupping for thousands of years to treat a wide range of health problems. It is designed to help the body reduce inflammation by using suction. Think of it kind of like getting a massage in reverse.
What is it used for?

?Cupping can help athletes relieve muscle tension and tightness, but it can also help anyone with pain, stiffness or breathing problems,? says Dawn Powell-Londono, a licensed acupuncturist and Chinese herbalist who practices cupping at SCL Health's Bridges Health and Wellness.
How does it help?

In Chinese medicine, pain is viewed as stagnation or something that isn?t moving. ?If you have an injury, the swelling sometimes just sits there, or if you have arthritis, the inflammation doesn?t go anywhere,? says Powell-Londono. ?Cupping can help the body reabsorb the fluid and move the swelling out of the area.?
What does it look like?

Cups used in cupping look like glass or plastic snow globe-like balls that range in size from three-quarters of an inch to four inches in diameter. They?re placed on the skin while air is removed by a pump or by lighting a flame inside of the cup to create a small vacuum.
Is it painful?

Cupping doesn?t hurt, but it may leave a temporary mark. Powell-Londono says the practitioners at the Olympics were more aggressive with the suction than she normally uses on her patients. ?It?s not painful, but every once in a while, there?ll be redness that occurs called a ?sha? reaction,? she says. ?If you have a lot of stagnation in the area, you may see some of that reaction, but it won?t be quite as dark as the spots that Michael Phelps had.?
How do I get started with cupping?

Patients can come in as often as two to three times a week for cupping, but it?s usually used in conjunction with acupuncture. ?Cupping is a great adjunct because you can feel better faster, whereas with just acupuncture, you?ll feel better, but it might be a couple days later,? she says.","https://www.sclhealth.org/blog/2019/10/learn-all-about-cupping-therapy-and-the-many-health-benefits/","cupping benefits","google",NA,NA
"What Is Cupping Therapy?

    Cupping types
    Treatment
    Conditions
    Side effects
    Warnings
    Takeaway

What is cupping?

Cupping is a type of alternative therapy that originated in China. It involves placing cups on the skin to create suction. The suction may facilitate healing with blood flow.

Proponents also claim the suction helps facilitate the flow of ?qi? in the body. Qi is a Chinese word meaning life force. A famous Taoist alchemist and herbalist, Ge Hong, reportedly first practiced cupping. He lived from A.D. 281 to 341.

Many Taoists believe that cupping helps balance yin and yang, or the negative and positive, within the body. Restoring balance between these two extremes is thought to help with the body?s resistance to pathogens as well as its ability to increase blood flow and reduce pain.

Cupping increases blood circulation to the area where the cups are placed. This may relieve muscle tension, which can improve overall blood flow and promote cell repair. It may also help form new connective tissues and create new blood vessels in the tissue.

People use cupping to complement their care for a host of issues and conditions.
What are the different types of cupping?

Cupping was originally performed using animal horns. Later, the ?cups? were made from bamboo and then ceramic. The suction was primarily created through the use of heat. The cups were originally heated with fire and then applied to the skin. As they cooled, the cups drew the skin inside.

Modern cupping is often performed using glass cups that are rounded like balls and open on one end.

There are two main categories of cupping performed today:

    Dry cupping is a suction-only method.
    Wet cupping may involve both suction and controlled medicinal bleeding.

Your practitioner, your medical condition, and your preferences will help determine what method is used.
What should I expect during a cupping treatment?

During a cupping treatment, a cup is placed on the skin and then heated or suctioned onto the skin. The cup is often heated with fire using alcohol, herbs, or paper that?s placed directly into the cup. The fire source is removed, and the heated cup is placed with the open side directly on your skin.

Some modern cupping practitioners have shifted to using rubber pumps to create suction versus more traditional heat methods.

When the hot cup is placed on your skin, the air inside the cup cools and creates a vacuum that draws the skin and muscle upward into the cup. Your skin may turn red as the blood vessels respond to the change in pressure.

With dry cupping, the cup is set in place for a set time, usually between 5 and 10 minutes. With wet cupping, cups are usually only in place for a few minutes before the practitioner removes the cup and makes a small incision to draw blood.

After the cups are removed, the practitioner may cover the previously cupped areas with ointment and bandages. This helps prevent infection. Any mild bruising or other marks usually go away within 10 days of the session.

Cupping is sometimes performed along with acupuncture treatments. For best results, you may also want to fast or eat only light meals for two to three hours before your cupping session.
What conditions can cupping treat?

Cupping has been used to treat a wide variety of conditions. It may be particularly effective at easing conditions that create muscle aches and pains.

Since the cups can also be applied to major acupressure points, the practice is possibly effective at treating digestive issues, skin issues, and other conditions commonly treated with acupressure.

A 2012 review of studiesTrusted Source suggests cupping therapy?s healing power may be more than just a placebo effect. The researchers found that cupping therapy may help with the following conditions, among others:

    shingles
    facial paralysis
    cough and dyspnea
    acne
    lumbar disc herniation
    cervical spondylosis

However, the authors acknowledge that most of the 135 studies they reviewed contain a high level of bias. More studies are needed to assess the true effectiveness of cupping.
Side effects



Preparing for your cupping appointment

Cupping is a long-practiced treatment that may help ease the symptoms of both temporary and chronic health conditions.

As with many alternative therapies, keep in mind that there haven?t been extensive studies performed without bias to fully assess its true effectiveness.

If you choose to try cupping, consider using it as a complement to your current doctor visits, not a substitute.

Here are some things to consider before beginning cupping therapy:

    What conditions does the cupping practitioner specialize in treating?
    What method of cupping does the practitioner use?
    Is the facility clean? Does the practitioner implement safety measurements?
    Does the practitioner have any certifications?
    Do you have a condition that may benefit from cupping?

Before beginning any alternative therapy, remember to let your doctor know that you?re planning to incorporate it into your treatment plan. ","https://www.healthline.com/health/cupping-therapy#takeaway","cupping benefits","google","Cupping therapy isn?t recommended for everyone. Extra caution should be taken for the following groups:

    Children. Children under 4 years old shouldn?t receive cupping therapy. Older children should only be treated for very short periods.
    Seniors. Our skin becomes more fragile as we age. Any medication you may be taking might have an effect as well.
    Pregnant people. Avoid cupping the abdomen and lower back.
    Those who are currently menstruating.

Don?t use cupping if you use blood-thinning medication. Also avoid cupping if you have:

    a sunburn
    a wound
    a skin ulcer
    experienced recent trauma
    an internal organ disorder","There aren?t many side effects associated with cupping. The side effects you may experience will typically occur during your treatment or immediately after.

You may feel lightheaded or dizzy during your treatment. You may also experience sweating or nausea.

After treatment, the skin around the rim of the cup may become irritated and marked in a circular pattern. You may also have pain at incision sites or feel lightheaded or dizzy shortly after your session.

Infection is always a risk after undergoing cupping therapy. The risk is small and usually avoided if your practitioner follows the right methods for cleaning your skin and controlling infection before and after your session.

Other risks include:

    scarring of the skin
    hematoma (bruising)

Your practitioner should wear an apron, disposable gloves, and goggles or other eye protection. They should also use clean equipment and have regular vaccines to ensure protection against certain diseases, like hepatitis.

Always research practitioners thoroughly to protect your own safety.

If you experience any of these issues, consult your practitioner. They may offer remedies or steps you can take before your session in order to avoid any discomfort.
Things to keep in mind

Most medical professionals don?t have training or a background in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Your doctor may be cautious or uncomfortable with answering questions related to healing methods like cupping.

Some CAM practitioners may be particularly enthusiastic about their methods, even suggesting you skip over conventional medical treatments advised by your doctor.

But if you do choose to try cupping as part of your treatment plan, discuss your decision with your doctor. Continue with regular doctor visits related to your condition to get the best of both worlds."
"Top 10 Benefits of a Massage Gun

September 23, 2019

Massage guns are one of the recent innovations made for the muscle recovery process and since its invention in 2008, it has grown to become a favorite tool for many athletes in the world looking to take charge of their muscle therapy and recovery process.

A massage gun is known to offer the same results as a deep tissue massage. The beauty of this is that you can get all the benefits within minutes in your most convenient time while following your schedule. It makes it easier for most people to manage their health, whether they are in sports or they are just fitness lovers. 

These massage guns have been in high demand in recent years, which can only be traced to the many benefits they have to offer, from relieving aches and pain to increased blood circulation among others. Worthy of note is that it also helps shorten recovery time while it does all of these.

Achedaway Massage Gun

Below are the top 10 benefits of a massage gun that you should know:

1. Sports Performance, Injury Prevention, and Recovery

Percussive massage provided by a massage gun helps improve the muscle contraction, which results in the lengthening and strengthening of the muscles and fascial tissues. Making massage therapy part of your lifestyle and post-workout routine is a great way to relieve stress. The main purpose of a massage is to help relax the muscles and relieve tension in the body, which would help shorten the muscle recovery time between workouts, as toxic debris are constantly being eliminated to allow the muscles bounce back within the shortest possible time. 

For every deep tissue massage with the massage guns, fluids and tension are released within the deep muscles and this results in improved circulation, as the blood and tissue cells exchange substances which help boost tissue metabolism. The supply of nutrients and oxygen is also improved due to the massage, therefore increasing blood circulation throughout the body. It also helps prevent overtraining due to the sedating effect it has on the nervous system. It heals and prevents injuries, as the improved circulation helps break down adhesions and the increased production of nutrients and fluids could help with quick tissue repair. 

Sports performance is also improved, as the massage guns help increase power and performance, which makes the muscles more flexible and efficient.

2. Advanced Vibrational Healing & Powerful Pain Relief

Vibrational healing is a form of healing that is based on vibrations and subtle energies, without any dependence on other systems of healing. It is based on each person?s unique energy field and is known to be efficient. Interestingly, a massage gun provides this same benefit, as it delivers vibrations deep into the muscle by using the ?percussive therapy? technique. The vibrations from the massage help improve blood and lymph circulation around the body, which helps produce more oxygen and nutrients into the muscles. The result of this is speedy recovery, improved range of motion, pain relief and relieving muscle fatigue and soreness. Pain in the neck, shoulders and lower back can easily be relieved with the advanced vibrating effect from massage guns.

3. Rehabilitation

Massage is known to be one of the most effective forms of injury rehabilitation therapy, as it not only speeds up the recovery process but also prevents re-injury. Massage guns work as a supplement to the standard injury rehabilitation process and encourage healing and recovery of atrophied muscles due to trauma or disease. Improved circulation into the muscles and fascial tissues helps the injured areas to become more flexible and heal within a short time. 

4. Release Lactic Acid

Lactic acid forms when the oxygen levels in the body are low and the body begins to compensate for it by converting newly formed lactate into energy. This often happens during intense exercise and the lactic acid tends to build up in the bloodstream faster than it can burn off. This could make you feel exhausted, nauseated and have cramp feelings in your muscles. A massage gun can reverse this, as it helps the release of lactic acid and other toxins from the muscles to surrounding tissues. This will help reduce the risk of muscle soreness that often comes after a prolonged exertion due to lactic acid accumulation.

Release Lactic Acid

5. Increases Blood and Lymphatic Flow

Massage guns provide deep tissue massage, which increases the rate of blood flow and stimulates the nerve receptors responsible for dilating blood vessels. The lymph works to remove waste and toxins from the bodily tissues and the flow is controlled by muscle contractions; this means less active people might not be stimulating enough lymph circulation while very active people might be accumulating too much of it. This could result in lymphedema if not controlled. However, with a massage gun, you can create a balance, as it helps improve circulation throughout the lymphatic system.

6. Activates the Nervous System and Muscles

The nervous system stimulates and regulates the activity of the muscles and maintains the body?s homeostasis. For every activity on the muscles, the nervous system gets notified. Massage guns help stimulate the receptors of the sympathetic nervous system, which causes vasodilation in the skin and muscles, thereby releasing tension and helping the muscles relax while improving mobility. 

Muscle recovery

7. Relieves Muscle Spasms and Stiffness

Massage guns can help relieve muscle spasms and stiffness that may arise from an intense workout. The muscle spasm often leads to ischemia in the muscles, which means the muscle is lacking proper blood flow. This could result in spasms that are painful to the touch. The massage gun works by applying pressure to the muscle, tendons, and ligaments to help them become relaxed, thereby reducing spasms and painful contractions

8. Breaks up Scar Tissue

Scar tissue is made up of collagen fibers that help with the repair of damaged fibers in the body. However, the elasticity of the tissues does not measure up with the natural muscle tissues of the body. Massage guns provide deep tissue massage, which will help break down these scar tissues, thereby alleviating pain and relieving restriction. You can use massage guns not only for sports injuries but also for post-surgery scar tissues. 

deep tissue massage gun

9. Enhance Range of Motion Quickly

Massage guns work on the muscles, connective tissues, tendons, ligaments, and joints, all of which work together to aid mobility. With the consistent use of massage guns, the joints will be more flexible and less prone to strains and sprains. The relaxed muscles and fascial tissue and improved blood circulation work together to improve flexibility and range of motion of the body. Improved range of motion would then result in added advantages like enhancing athletic performance and improved stimulation of the body?s natural lubricants to help keep the body flexible. 

10. Wellness Benefits

There are many other health benefits of massage guns apart from relaxing the muscles and alleviating pain. This includes increased mobility, improved sleep, and improved immunity. It is also helpful for depression and anxiety, fibromyalgia, digestive disorders, and stress-related insomnia.

Relax your body and mind
Vibration massage is recommended as the best solution to relax your body and mind while improving overall body movements. Experts reveal that it can reduce tensions by leading a positive impact on happy hormones in the human body. Moreover, percussion massager makes it a proven treatment for improving serotonin level that further leads to a happy feeling.
Muscle strength and mass
Vibration therapy is effective enough to improve the flexibility of muscle groups while forcing them to reach up to the plates in a specific amount of time. This process is useful to keep muscles active; at the same time, power massager enables motor points to maintain higher contraction rate. With regular practice, your muscles will soon gain the desired level of strength and mass while added endurance. Fitness experts believe that it is the most significant factor in physical training.
Enhanced blood circulation
While improving muscle contractions, this vibration recovery treatment also helps to enhance blood circulation levels in the vessels. When professional therapists perform massage therapy, they encourage the generation of red and white blood cells inside the human body. The higher blood circulation further leads to improved performance of metabolic systems, and as a result, your body starts feeling fitter.
Alleviate pain
Vibrational massage therapy is a proven method to reduce pain even without consuming any medication. Some reports reveal that this therapy can treat chronic pain conditions as well by numbing the affected part of the body. This specialized massage tool based treatment assists in relaxing the muscle around the paining part of the body.
Weight loss and fat burning
How can we forget to talk about the most amazing benefit of percussion therapy? Many overweight people have used it until now, and they are extremely happy with the results. It is well proven that vibration massage therapy is the best solution for improving metabolism rate that further contributes to burning more calories. As a result, you can get rid of stored fat while reducing unwanted body weight. At the same time, vibration massage therapy works for bringing your body into the desired shape while enhancing skin tone and smoothness as well.

In short, percussive therapy is one of the best treatments for all chronic health diseases and painful conditions. Prefer to choose the most reliable professionals to avail adequate treatment.","https://massageguns.com/pages/benefits-of-massage-gun","massage gun benefits","google",NA,NA

If you?ve ever gotten a massage, you know just how life-changing it can be, whether you?re an athlete constantly dealing with aches and pains or a regular person struggling with good old-fashioned ?text neck.? With a few elbows in your back and a few sweeps over those pressure points, you?re suddenly in a lot less pain ? and definitely less stressed.

Massage guns have been having a major moment. They have a wide range of price points and users, from trainers and chiropractors to the cast of ?Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.? But do these little (and sometimes extremely expensive) machines really work? And if so, are they worth the money? Let?s take a closer look.

FYI, HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.
What to know before investing in a super-expensive massage gun

According to an ad for the much-loved TheraGun (which can cost up to $600), the massage gun works by ?increasing blood flow, decreasing lactic acid and interrupting the pain cycle in the brain.?

Eva Carey, director of massage therapy at Zeel, said a top-notch massage gun can get the job done ? but you should take your time learning how to use each feature. ?Higher-end models can offer more application choices,? she said. ?And make sure to use them with caution!?

If a $400 to $600 massage gun isn?t in your financial future, worry not ? the less expensive ones could be a good investment, too. If you?re willing to take the time to understand how different massage guns work and do your research before buying one, you might be able to find exactly what you need without paying an arm and a leg for it.

?Models work with either a circular or thumping motion, with varying speeds and pressure,? Carey said. ?Considerations when shopping for one include weight of the unit, noise (a loud appliance is definitely not relaxing), and number of tips available for generalized or more specific application.?","https://www.huffpost.com/entry/massage-guns-expert-review_l_5cc861cfe4b05379114b7307","massage gun benefits","google",NA,NA

Everything You Need To Know About Massage Guns

Get ready to bounce back from workouts faster, and accelerate your gains, too!

It looks like a power tool, and can sound like one, too. But it just may be your best method of recovering from a tough workout ? and warming up, too.

Meet the massage gun, the hot new trend that just may be landing in a gym near you. Over the last three years, more and more people have grown aware of the need to increase blood flow in muscles, whether you?re training or recovering. Various methods have grown popular to do that, with everything from foam rollers to vibration therapies to standard massage landing in gyms.

The massage gun inhabits this same space, and while it?s supported by limited research, the theory behind it is sound, and it has the potential to change the way you warm up and recover. Several pro athletes have been seen using massage guns during games, with NBA star Kyrie Irving the most prominent. In the 2017 NBA Finals, Irving was spotted midway through a critical game lying on his back, a trainer using one to keep him loose.

But athletes aren't the only ones using this to keep their bodies in top form. Also known as percussive therapy, I?ve been using massage guns on my clients for several years and the results have been strong. If you train hard and are looking for an edge, a way to recover more quickly and get into your workouts more aggressively, this is a device you should consider.
What Exactly Is a Massage Gun?

The massage gun trend is a relatively new one in fitness. You?ve used foam rollers before, and vibrating foam rollers appeared on the market three or four years ago. The theory behind these foam rollers was that the vibrations confused something called the Golgi tendon response, which would help to relax tight muscles.

Then, two years ago, the Theragun took off, kicking off a wave of massage guns. Hyperice?s Hypervolt and several others followed, and earlier this year, Theragun introduced the Theragun G3 Pro (below).

The massage gun generally looks something like a power tool, and once it?s turned on, it whirs like one too (although recent models have quieted that). To use it, you simply aim it at your skin, about an inch away, and let it pulsate back and forth, relaxing muscles and promoting bloodflow in much the same way a vibrating foam roller does. It?s easier to use than a foam roller though, and more natural.

In theory, massage guns also offer a chance to modulate pain. What about pain modulation? Well, the pain you feel typically manifests as a specific frequency. Healthy nerve impulses should react to pain in milliseconds, but at certain frequencies, your pain may not be able to keep up with that. So in theory, a massage gun vibrating at the right frequency may ?trick? the nervous system into blocking pain. We call this the ?pain gate theory?.
How You Use Your Massage Gun

Part of the beauty of the massage gun is that it?s incredibly easy to use. Just point at a target, press, and let it do its work. But to get the most out of your massage gun you?ll want to keep a few basics in mind.

Before you get started, turn it on, so that the head begins pulsing. Then float it along the desired muscle that you?re trying to loosen or warm up. There?s never a need to press extra-hard with your massage gun; the pulses do their job. When you find a trigger point, a tight, knotty area of muscle that?s a little more painful and sensitive than the rest of the muscle, linger on that area, just as you would with a foam roller.

Move your massage gun slowly along the muscle. There?s no need to rush the process. Enjoy the massage.

Before Your Workout

Massage guns are primarily thought of as ?recovery? tools in today?s fitness culture, but you can use them for either situation. In fact, using them as a warmup tool helps get you off the hook of that dreaded foam rolling ordeal.

In theory, the percussive therapy is doing several things you want in a warmup. First off, it?s heightening bloodflow in your targeted muscles. Secondly, the pulsating is turning on your sympathetic nervous system, the fight-or-flight system that preps your body for activity and sport.

To use the massage gun to prime for a workout, take aim at the muscle group you?re going to train. So if you?re going to bench press, you?ll want to hit your pecs, or if you?re going to do pulldowns and rows, you?ll want to hit your lats. Spend 30 seconds on working along the muscle belly only; never venture toward a joint. Stay on the thickest part of the muscle. Work back and forth along the span of each muscle.
During a Workout

Between sets, you can also take advantage of a massage gun, loosening tense, tight areas so you can get more out of your next set. For example, you may feel your chest tighten slightly after a set of bench press reps and be tempted to stretch. But research tells us that statically stretching a muscle may decrease potential and force output. Instead, use your massage gun for 15 seconds on a muscle area that feels tense. This should increase blood flow and excite the muscle, loosening it again for the rest of your workout.
After Your Workout

When you?re done with your workout, your body?s in a heightened state. But a massage gun can, in theory, help you relax your nervous system. The sooner you fire up your parasympathetic nervous system, which helps govern rest and relaxation, the sooner your body shifts into recovery mode.

To use the massage gun to do this, fire it up and spend 90 to 120 seconds moving up and down each muscle group. Again, you?re doing this throughout the muscle belly, not near joints. This will help relax your muscles.","https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a27007501/massage-guns-recovery-warmup/","massage gun benefits","google",NA,NA

The day after a heavy fitness session, a simple flight of stairs can become an unconquerable mountain. Lifting yourself off the toilet becomes your Everest. The go-to response to ease burning calves and aching glutes is normally to jump on a foam roller and flatten out your muscles until the pain subsides.

It is a triangular ?gun? with a padded cushion on one end and a button at the other that controls the speed. Turn it on and the power it exhibits is kind of scary ? and loud.

It?s a far cry from the grunting, flailing mess you become whenever you foam roll in the gym. The Theragun aims to make it super simple to heal your whole body. The gun is lightweight and versatile, so you can reach even tricky areas ? like your back and shoulders ? without too much trouble.

While most fitness experts seem to agree that foam rolling is better for your muscles than doing nothing, there are some who claim that it can actually be dangerous when done incorrectly. So what is the truth? And what is the best way to actually use foam rolling to your advantage? ?Foam rolling can be a great method for assisting the reduction of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). It is one of multiple strategies we can employ to aid the recovery process,? explains Joe Delaney, personal trainer at Ultimate Performance. ?It is one method people can use to help shift the build up of lactic acid accumulated from a heavy training session. ?Foam rolling can help bring new blood into the targeted areas which can assist in the recovery process. ?Furthermore, as we get sore, we tend to avoid wanting to move those sore muscles, so foam rolling can help increase the range of motion too. ?Overuse can cause bruising, but this is in the extreme.

Used a particular massage gun? Submit a review

Massage guns are a new tool that have started getting some popularity in late 2019 and early 2020, and many people have now started buying their own massage guns. So what are the benefits of using a massage gun, and are there any disadvantages? And how substantial are these benefits? Over a period of several weeks, I tried a few of the most popular massage guns including the TimTam All New Power Massager, the Hyperice Hypervolt Plus, the Achedaway Vibration and Percussion Massager and the Sportneer Percussive Massage Gun, and found that they helped me out drastically. Here are the main benefits that using these massage guns brought me (in no particular order):

    Releasing lactic acid: When oxygen levels in the body are low, lactic acid builds up in the bloodstream and the body can have difficulties burning it off (this happens a lot after exercise) which can lead to cramps in your muscles. By using a massage gun, you can help the body to release lactic acid and other toxins.
    Vibrational healing: A massage gun is able to deliver deep vibrations in your muscles using a percussive therapy method that helps to improve circulation in your body, and therefore allow more oxygen and nutrients into your muscles. This can be a major help to alleviate pain and recover faster, and I found that through vibrational healing, my body was able to recover from workouts much quicker.
    Injury prevention: Many sports injuries are caused by muscle cramps and the lack of adequate recovery before straining the muscle again, and by using a massage gun to improve your blood and oxygen circulation, the likelihood of overtraining and wearing out a muscle too fast is reduced.
    Rehabilitation: If you do have an injury, massage guns can help you to speed up your recovery and make you heal faster by improving circulation. Of course, a massage gun should not be the only or even the main treatment you use to recover, but it can definitely provide significant assistance.
    Helps to counter muscle spasms: By applying pressure to your muscles after a workout, your muscles become more relaxed and are less likely to spasm or become stiff.
    Improve range of motion: After using massage guns, you?ll find that your joints are more flexible and have better blood circulation, thereby improving your range of motion.
    Breaking up your scar tissue: Scar tissue helps to repair damaged fibers in your body, but has a different elasticity than other muscle tissues in your body. As such, breaking down this scar tissue will help with alleviating pain.

Enough of the advantages of massage guns ? what about the disadvantages?

First, good massage guns tend to cost hundreds of dollars, so there is a definite cost component you need to take into consideration, and there is always the possibility of accidental injury with massages. As massage guns are also a relatively new product, there is also more data that needs to come in before we can make a concrete statement on whether they can work for everyone. While  myself and others have benefited from using massage guns, there?s always the chance that they?re not worth the money for you or do not offer any noticeable benefits.
What are the best massage guns?

I am currently working hard to write detailed reviews of all the most popular massage guns with the aim of helping our readers find the one that works best for them (UPDATE: see my article on massage gun reviews here). Regardless of what massage gun you choose, however, I believe you?ll find that it?s well worth the investment, and I predict that massage guns will continue to gain popularity throughout 2020 and beyond.
What do people say about massage guns?

We put out a request for people to write about their experiences with massage guns and whether they found them useful. We got some good submissions ? here they are:

Based on my experience, massage guns are a great bet in combating pain irrespective of the body location. They have shown to be more effective than the conventional foam rollers, which is the major muscle pain killer before now.

Here are some benefits of using massage guns:

    Simplicity of usage
    It fastens the healing process of my muscles by majorly increasing oxygen supply and growth hormones
    Ease the pain associated with soft tissue damage
    Release Lactic Acid
    Increases Blood and Lymphatic Flow
    It can also be used in massaging other areas, apart from muscular areasWere they worth the money?

Were they worth the money?

My short answer is yes because for me if you invest in this kind of power tool, it?s like having your own on-demand massage therapist and that?s for less.

If you?ve ever gotten a massage, you know just how life-changing it can be, whether you?re an athlete constantly dealing with aches and pains or a regular person struggling with good-old-fashioned ?text neck.?

With a few elbows in your back and a few sweeps over those pressure points, you?re suddenly in a lot less pain and definitely less stressed.

In sum, we all get stressed from daily life activities. However, failure to manage this stress properly could hurt your health over time.

A massage gun could be a hack to successfully managing stress within the shortest possible time and in the most convenient way while getting the many other benefits attached to it.

? Nancy Baker, ChildMode

Massage Guns: YES I own one and YES I love it! It was def. worth the money however I made sure not to go out and buy the most expensive one on the market. The largest tangible benefit was helping me to deal with muscle tension after teaching upper body HIIT classes. Many times after working out my shoulders and back my trapezius muscles get very tight which then leads to neck soreness then leading to a headache. Instead of spending $45-$60.00 on a chiropractor or massage therapist, I use my massage gun to release the pressure and tension in my upper back/neck area.

I also use the massage gun to work on my lower body, IT band, glutes, and hamstrings before and after running.

Massage Gun Benefits

A Massage Gun empowers you to take control of your own muscular recovery process. The percussive and vibrational nature of the massager helps to treat sore lactic acid filled muscles and speed up the delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and recovery process. This is achieved by providing concentrated, rapid, short duration pulses deep into the tissues of the body. These pulses heavily increase blood flow and circulation to the tissues accelerating their growth and repair, relieving pain and increasing range of motion and function.

Effectively, a Massage Gun offers the same results as a deep tissue or remedial massage in minutes not hours, on your own time and according to your schedule.

Massage Guns are designed and engineered to treat sore lactic acid filled muscles and release tight joints. The deep muscle stimulation provided by Massage Gun therapy can deliver all of the following benefits:

    Ease soft tissue pain
    Release lactic acid
    Accelerate muscle recovery
    Stimulate muscle growth
    Improve blood circulation
    Enhance range of motion quickly
    Gentle muscle stretch
    Improve muscle responsiveness

Massage Guns apply pulses of concentrated pressure deep into your muscle tissue. This form of deep-tissue massage can work knots and tension out of the muscles while improving blood flow and quickly enhancing range of motion. 

When used properly, a Massage Gun can shorten your recovery time while relieving some of the pain, tension and soreness that comes naturally from intense and regular exercise.
THE IMPORTANCE OF RECOVERY

No matter where you sit on the athletic spectrum, if you are looking to lose weight, build strength and fitness or just trying to achieve your physical potential, your body requires rest and time to recover.

This recovery process is so important because where appropriate measures are not taken prior to recommencing your training, the chance of temporary or even permanent injury are severely increased. This presents a challenge for anyone trying to improve their physical state and even more so athletes, who dont have the luxury of long rest periods.","https://www.massagegun.com.au/pages/massage-gun-benefits","massage gun benefits","google",NA,NA
"What's the deal with massage guns, and do they really work?
Banu Ibrahim, CNN Underscored
Updated Wed March 4, 2020

It may look like a power drill at first glance, and sound like one too, but the massage gun ? the Theragun, TimTam and other popular designs ? is actually today's buzziest muscle recovery tool.

Their popularity has been helped along by professional athletes publicly using them, as well as viral Instagram videos that show the massage gun's rubber mallet sending a mesmerizing ripple effect across the skin's surface.

But while the celebrity and social media cred would have many of us jumping on the bandwagon and buying massage guns for ourselves, there's a huge barrier to entry: the price. The Theragun, for instance, one of the leaders in the percussive therapy field, goes for about $600. Which leads us to question: Are these devices really worth it?

What do massage guns do?

Massage guns offer what's known as percussive or vibration therapy. This type of massage provides rapid bursts of pressure into the body's muscle tissue (hence the rippling effect of massage guns) as its head oscillates back and forth. Masseurs and masseuses have traditionally used a series of light strikes from the hands or wrists to the given muscle group to get this effect. However, massage guns let athletes get the same benefits, but in the comfort of their own homes (and without needing to pay routinely for luxury spa services). And unlike myofascial massaging tools, such as foam rollers, that can yield similar results, massage guns can hyper-target a specific problem area. For those who find foam rollers uncomfortable or too manual of a process, massage guns offer a more streamlined, automatic solution.

Percussive therapy doesn't completely eliminate muscle soreness. But what it does do is increase blood flow to a specific muscle area, which can help reduce inflammation and muscle tension and break up those pesky knots that seem to linger after a hard workout. Massage guns are also used prior to intense workouts to help warm up muscles ahead of activity.

Do massage guns actually work?

As percussive therapy becomes more popular, more studies are being released about its benefits and potential limitations. A 2014 study suggested that vibration therapy and massage (both of which are part of percussive therapy) are equally effective methods to prevent DOMS, delayed onset muscle soreness, meaning you're less likely to feel muscle pain or tightness 24 to 72 hours after an intense workout.

Tapotement, the Swedish massage technique that employs the same principle (but without the equipment), also has been shown to improve athletes' overall agility and performance with just five minutes of treatment.

Even though scientific signs seem to point in favor of these devices, it's important to note that there's not a lot of research on massage guns specifically, as well as the vibration and amplitude of percussive therapy they deliver.

There is plenty of anecdotal evidence out there supporting the idea that massage guns do help, however. Theragun, for instance, was developed by Jason S. Wersland, a chiropractor who created the device to help with his own rehabilitation after a motorcycle accident. Wersland set out to create a massage tool that would help ease pain with its use of high frequency and amplitude. According to Wersland, since its inception, other health professionals have sworn by the Theragun. ""I have dozens of physicians, physical therapists, chiropractors around the world who say this changes the way they practice,"" he says.

And Daniel Giordano, a physical therapist and co-founder of Bespoke Treatments, also swears by the device and calls massage guns like the Theragun ""an absolute game-changer in rehabilitation and sports performance.""

Are there affordable massage guns?

As mentioned, Theraguns tend to be among the more expensive percussive therapy tools out there, and the company's line of massage guns ranges from $249 for its more basic Liv device to its $599 G3 Pro, a professional-grade device that can deliver strokes 40 times a second and give users a 60% deeper massage than standard vibration massagers. Another premium brand is TimTam, which ranges from $249 to $499. So if you're looking for a luxury option, there are plenty of designs that suit.

If $249 is too steep for your current budget, know that there are affordable massage gun options out there. On Amazon, for instance, there's an array of top-rated models priced as low as $100.

Opove M3 Pro Massage Gun ($199.99; amazon.com)

Over 4,000 Amazon shoppers have rated this affordable massage gun a stellar 4.8 stars out of 5. This device comes with a variety of heads as well as three different speed levels so you can customize your massage based on the target area. A safety timer will turn off the device automatically to ensure you aren't overworking your muscles.

One of the most affordable, but still highly rated, massage guns we've seen on Amazon comes from Sylphim. This iteration comes with another impressive 4.8-star rating. It has a quiet design that's ideal for gyms and other public workout spaces. But most importantly, it doesn't skimp on quality.

One reviewer writes, ""I purchased this for my husband, who complains frequently of tennis elbow and shoulder pain. He used this after a particularly strenuous workout (lifting weights) and you'd have thought this thing was the best massage he's ever gotten!""

Why Buy a Massage Gun?
Theragun G3 PRO

The deep-tissue percussion massage provided by a massage gun enhances and speeds up the recovery of muscles after workouts.

It releases lactic acid from the muscles, flushing out metabolic waste from a hard workout. It increases blood flow, making oxygen and nutrients available to muscles so they can start building back up.

By penetrating the tissue, percussion massage guns also give muscles a gentle stretch, which helps improve your range of motion.

Using it before a workout can improve your performance and help prevent injury simply by loosening muscles and enhancing their mobility [1].

Studies show that percussion massages significantly reduce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) after strenuous activity.

Deep tissue massage also helps balance your hormones and improve your mood by lowering cortisol levels and triggering the release of endorphins.

The best part about a percussion massage gun is that it?s easy to take with you on the go.

You can bring it to the gym, use it at your office to combat tightness at your desk, and take it with you when you travel.

Unlike foam rollers and massage balls, percussion massage guns don?t require the effort it takes to push into muscle tissue with your own body weight. It?s also easier to get precise and pinpoint specific trigger points.
Percussion Massage Gun Vs. Percussion Massager: What?s the Difference?

Percussion massagers work by delivering a ?hammer? like type of massage where the head of the massager bounces and hits the body wherever you position it over.

For the sake of simplicity we like to divide percussion massagers into two categories according to their design.
The PureWave CM-07

The first is percussion massage guns and the second is percussion massagers with long handles.

While they both deliver percussion massage therapy, the main difference is that a percussion massage gun puts more power behind it.

It?s designed ergonomically to mimic a heat gun, a staple gun or power tool, so you can target a specific point accurately.

The other kind of percussion massagers are more wand- or stick-like, whereas the grip on a percussion massage gun makes it easier to control.

On the other hand, the long-handled percussion massager can make it easier to reach your back muscles, whereas a percussion massage gun may not have as much reach.

If you think a standard percussion massager with a long handle is more for you, check out our post on the best handheld percussion massagers.

In this post we are going to focus on massage guns.
How to Identify a Quality Percussion Massage Gun

There are all kinds of options on the market, including low-quality massagers trying to copy the bigger name brands.

We?ve tried a lot and have now learnt what to look out for when choosing a good massage gun.

Here?s what you should look for to identify a great percussion massage gun to ensure your investment is worthwhile:
Design
Massage guns come with different and unique designs

Massage guns typically come in a traditional ?axe? shape however they are starting to appear in all kinds of shapes and sizes.

Look for one that comes with a comfortable-to-hold design that also has the ability to hit the hard-to-reach areas of your body.
Long Battery Life

Battery matters when it comes to percussion massage guns, because they?re cordless.

An effective massage depends on a strong, long-lasting battery that can power the motor and sustain operation as long as you need for a massage session.

The last thing you want is to fully charge up your battery only for it to die 10 minutes into your session leaving you waiting around for it to charge up again.

There are two ways out of this. Get a massage gun which can deliver long sessions without needing a recharge. Or look for massagers that come with interchangeable batteries, so you quickly switch over to a fully charged one if you run out of charge.
Speed and Power

Speed and power dictate the intensity of massage a percussion gun offers, so it?s important to have a motor with higher wattage and more torque.

If you choose a massage gun without a lot of power you may grow out of it quickly as you get used to it. You would then need to buy a more powerful one to get more release in your muscles.

However, choosing one that is too powerful will be pointless for you if it?s too painful to use.

Choosing a massage gun with the right power for you is vital.
Options for Customization

Percussion massage guns that give you more options, including different speed settings, rotational angles and attachment heads, can give you more value.

That?s because they reach and target more areas of your body, as you can customize the intensity and size of the percussion head to meet the demands of different muscles.
Noise Level

The noise level of a massage tool is a make-or-break for some. Since massage guns are made to deliver a lot of power they are notoriously noisy.

If it bothers you or others in your home to use a massager on your body that?s as loud as a power tool or blender, look for one that?s designed to be quiet.

However, quieter percussion massage guns do tend to be more expensive and deliver less power, so it?s a trade-off.","https://www.drbodygadget.com/best-massage-gun/","massage gun benefits","google",NA,NA
"Cold Stone Therapy for Migraine Headaches

Kelly Lott, August 19, 2014

Pain, no matter where experienced or what the cause, can disrupt a person?s life on a variety of levels. From time away from work to missing time with family and friends, pain is often debilitating.

But massage therapists can help.

Cold Stone Therapy for Migraine Headaches

As more research confirms the benefits massage therapy has to offer, pain management is an area where massage continues to show promise. And the pain associated with migraines is no exception. Each year, approximately 50 million people in the United States suffer from migraine headaches, and two-thirds of sufferers are women.

That?s a lot of people in pain?and a lot of people you can reach with the message that massage therapy can help.
Common Migraine Features
Pain

For a headache to be classified as a migraine, the pain must be severe enough to limit or impair normal activity and be intensified by physical exertion. Migraines typically have some common features, including pain that is only on one side of the head but may shift sides during the same headache. Sufferers might also experience a pulsing or throbbing pain that generally lasts four to 72 hours. 
Pre-headache

Approximately 25 percent of migraine sufferers have a classic kind of headache. The prodrome? or pre-headache?may be experienced hours or even days before a migraine episode. Being able to recognize these symptoms can help massage therapists better assess a client?s pain and, in some cases, prevent a full migraine from occurring by properly managing pain early. 

Classic symptoms of a pre-headache include:

    a visual perception of flashing lightswavy lines or spots
    a partial loss of sight
    tingling or a numbness of the face
    confusion
    hypersensitivity to light and touch
    feeling heavy on one?s head and sharp pain in one area

Typically, these symptoms last from five to 10 minutes before subsiding, replaced by the throbbing, intense migraine headache. 
How Can Massage Help?

A three-pronged approach that includes aromatherapy, massage therapy and cold therapy can be effective in helping relieve the pain of migraine for many sufferers. 
Aromatherapy

The first step in stopping a migraine is to calm the client, and one effective way to achieve this goal is through aromatherapy. Depending on the trigger, you can have clients breathe different blends of oils. For example, if the client knows the migraine is the result of stress, try using essential oils of clary sage, spikenard, helichrysum and lavender. For an environmental trigger, you might try roman chamomile, lavender, peppermint and rosemary. 

Have the client breathe from each vial of oil, one at a time. Whatever they find most appealing, use this oil during the massage session. 
Massage Therapy

After choosing an oil, you?ll want to perform a series of headache point release techniques to help the client reach a calmer state. As a caution, you do not want to increase the blood flow to the neck and head, as doing so may result in accelerating the migraine pain. You may find that clients who are suffering from a migraine have several trigger points and very tight necks, and although not working on these areas sounds counterintuitive, the best thing to do is leave these areas alone for now.

Instead, the goal is to decrease blood flow, and stimulating these areas at this point can have the opposite effect. My research has shown that cranial sacral techniques are a wonderful accompaniment at this point in the treatment. After the headache is gone, at another treatment time, I suggest the therapist work the tight areas to help prevent future headaches.
Cold Therapy

The third phase is to address the vascular component of the migraine. The therapist will need to try to reduce the overabundant blood flow to the head and brain with cold stones, thereby normalizing the blood flow. In doing so, the therapist will be reducing or removing the pounding sensation the client is experiencing in their head while helping to calm the brain. My own experience suggests that positioning specifically designed marble stones, cooled to approximately 36 degrees and applied to specific areas of the face and neck, has the desired effect. Many migraine sufferers love the feeling of the cold stones, and within a short amount of time start to feel relief. 
Timing and Triggers

If at all possible, massage therapists will want to see the migrainer the day they feel the symptoms coming on because timing is critical to ward off the migraine before it can take full effect.

With busy schedules, however, you may not always be able to see a client right as they notice the symptoms. You can work alongside the client to try and figure out some of the triggers that cause migraine. Are they mostly occurring when the person has a particularly stressful week at work? Or maybe they notice that many of their migraines are happening when they eat certain foods. 

Whatever the trigger might be, being more aware of when a migraine may be more likely to happen can help both you and the client anticipate when a massage therapy session might be needed.
Quick Facts About Migraines

    Migraine attacks go beyond the symptoms of a normal headache and
    require serious attention.
    Often referred to as a spreading depression, migraines that start in a central location can rapidly spread.
    A spreading depression can move into the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve that affects the face), causing the blood vessels of the brain to constrict and then dilate continuously.
    Migraine attacks can occur daily and can be devastating to the sufferer?s ability to function normally.
    People with migraines can be more susceptible to epilepsy.



Massage therapy is known to help people manage pain. From injury to arthritis, the ways in which consumers are beginning to use massage therapy to better find relief are growing. For those clients who regularly suffer from migraines?or new clients who come with a history of migraines?massage therapy can be a real benefit.
Common Causes

Although the exact causes of migraines aren?t well understood, we do know that many people have some common triggers, including food allergies, caffeine addiction, environmental stimulation, stress and hormonal imbalance.","https://www.amtamassage.org/articles/3/MTJ/detail/2992/cold-stone-therapy-for-migraine-headaches","cold stone benefits","google","Contraindications

Always remember that if the headache is so severe that a client can?t stop vomiting, or if the headache suddenly becomes severe, referring a client to their primary care provider is imperative.

Or, if migraine is a new development for a current client, you need to make sure they have consulted with their primary care physician and been cleared for massage therapy before providing massage. 

If they have commonly suffered with headaches, are familiar with their symptoms, and have seen their health care provider and ruled out any medical issues, there are still cautions and contraindications massage therapists need to account for, including headaches that appear in a new pattern or have a gradual onset but aren?t getting any better. 

Massage therapists should also practice extreme caution with clients who exhibit additional symptoms that could point to infections such as meningitis or encephalitis, or nervous system injury, like stroke, aneurysm or a tumor. These symptoms would include slurred speech, numbness in any region of their body or difficulty with motor control, for example. ",NA
"Cold Stone Massage is Beneficial, Too - by admin@mcb on January 21 2016
Cold Stone Massage

Much has been written about hot stone massage and the many benefits that it can add to a massage session. Massage therapists should not overlook the benefits that cold stone massage can have as well.

The use of cold stones during a stone massage session helps to minimize soreness when performing deep tissue therapy. The cold stones also help to pull excess heat out of inflamed areas. By reducing inflammation, you can help your client?s natural healing processes to begin.

The use of cold massage stones are also known for helping to reduce anxiety, PMS and menstrual discomfort, nasal congestion, and fatigue.

During the early onset of a migraine headache, cold stones are excellent for directly impacting the vascular component of the migraine. By helping to constrict the blood vessels around the head and neck, blood flow will be reduced to a more normal level. This will help to reduce the throbbing  sensation,  which will enable the client will begin to feel more calm.
Cold Stones? Impact Varies by Duration

Short application of cold can increase peristalsis in the colon, stimulate muscles as well as help reduce inflammation, help constrict blood vessels, and speed digestion.

Prolonged application of cold will cause blood vessels to constrict, which can be helpful in situations like a nose bleed. Be careful with prolonged application of cold, as you can burn yourself or a client with cold, not just with heat.
How Cold Stones Differ From Hot Stones

Most cold stone sets are made from marble, while most hot stones are made from basalt. Not only is marble easy to cut and sand to the desired shapes and sizes, its light density allows it to absorb more heat away from the body than a denser stone does. Marble stones do require proper handling, as they can break or get scratched easily.","http://www.massagecredits.com/blog/2016/01/21/cold-stone-massage-is-beneficial-too/","cold stone benefits","google",NA,NA
"enefits of Cold Stone Massage

One of the benefits of cold stone massage is that it can provide a deep state of relaxation, a release of tension, as well as, a reduction of swelling and inflammation due to scar tissue, trauma or injuries to muscles.
705Save

Cold stones are critical in stone massage work as they decrease soreness when working on deeper muscles, draw heat away from the body, and help to strengthen on a cellular level.

Marble is used for cool stones because it?s less dense than the stones and can easily remove heat from the body.Cold marble massage stones are also known for helping to alleviate:

    Anxiety/Depression
    Stones that are cold help the mind to focus on the body and what it is experiencing rather than the mental/stress issues of life.PMS
    Stones are placed on the abdomen and/or on the back to help alleviate pain, bloating and swelling associated with a menstruation
    Sinusitis
    Cold stones are placed on the face (or on a cloth that is on the face to prevent skin damage) to help reduce congestion and nasal swelling
    High Blood Pressure (with Increased Circulation)
    When cold marble stones are placed in certain positions on the body, blood circulation increases and high blood pressure can decrease
    Energy
    By relieving bloating, inflammation and swelling, and therefore increasing circulation, other benefits of this therapy is an increase energy levels and stamina

Marble massage stones are metamorphosed limestone that is white or light in color and formed beneath the seabed. Physically, it?s thought that another of the benefits of cold stone massage using marble improves the processing of calcium in the body, stimulates the metabolism, fortifies immunity, and encourages the healing of tissue and bone.

In contrast to basalt, marble is very soft and easy to break or scratch. The marble has to be carefully cut and hand-sanded to just the right size and shape needed to assist in the bodywork that cryotherapy was meant to do for the body ? bringing down inflammation and starting the healing process.

Marble massage stones have to fit neatly into the therapist?s hand, in order to switch from hot to cool in moments. Again it?s vital to choose consistent, non-polished, properly shaped marble stones.

Keep in mind this is just a starting point or point of reference as you learn to configure a set that works best for you. Your set will vary based on your application.

Cold Stones

Marble massage stones are often shaped by hand and designed to provide a cool alternative for every hot stone used. Each marble stone is carefully crafted to perform a specific task.

There are several other specialized shapes available ; however, there are 18 marble stones in a Basic Stone set.

This is a great set, a 14pc Massage Marble Cold Stone Therapy Set w/Bamboo Case  that will help you give many different types of cold stone massage, including facial massage techniques. It also includes a bamboo storage case..

Getting Started with Cold Stone Massage Therapy

Getting Started with Cold Stone Massage Therapy

When you hear of stone massage, you might immediately think of hot stone massage. But did you know that cold stone massage, like hot stone massage, is an effective way to promote relaxation and revitalize the mind and body? You may also alternate using cold stones and hot stones during a massage session, called contrast therapy, to create a dynamic, invigorating experience for your client. Used by themselves or in conjunction with hot stones, cold stones create a distinct, refreshing experience and promote healing in several ways.

Who benefits from cold stone therapy?

Certain people are naturally ?hotter? and might prefer cooler things to feel more comfortable. These are people who prefer cold drinks or cooler weather. A cold stone massage is perfect for the coolness and invigoration that they seek. Athletes who have sustained injuries can also benefit from a cold stone massage. Cold constricts the blood vessels in the body and which alleviates swelling. It promotes healing and reduces pain in the injured muscles and tissues. Those who are experience sinus pain or inflammation are good candidates for cold stones, too.  The cold temperatures in the stones reduce nasal swelling and sinus inflammation. Cold stone massages are not recommended for clients who suffer from heart ailments, have easily inflamed skin, have kidney problems, and are sensitive to cold temperatures.  Cold stones should not be left on the skin for longer than ten minutes because freezing marble can ?burn? the skin if proper precautions are not met.

What is needed to give a cold stone massage?

Purchasing a good stone set is your first priority.  Cold stones are usually sourced from marble because marble retains cold quite effectively due to its calcium content.  Marble stone sets are usually sold in set of about eighteen stones and include stones of many shapes and sizes.  Since marble needs to be cut, shaped, and smoothed by hand and not by nature, the shape and sizes available are endless.  Make sure that the stones fit comfortably in your hand and are easy to hold.  Marble stones are more fragile than their hot stone counterparts, basalt stones, so make sure to handle them with care and keep them from banging into each other when transporting them.  Clean the stones by washing them with a little soap and water and after they dry, moisturize them with a little bit of carrier massage oil to extend their lives.

You can cool your massage stones in a variety of ways with a variety of implements.  Refrigerators or freezers work well to gradually cool down the stones.  For a quicker option, get a bowl of water, fill it with some ice and submerge the stones for a few minutes.  Have a towel nearby to wipe away excess water before placing the stones on the client?s body.   When travelling, you can use a small cooler with an ice pack to keep the stones at a cool temperature.  Whatever method of method you choose, make sure to test the temperature of the stones first before placing them on a client and always ask the client throughout the session if the temperature of the stones is comfortable for them.

Finally, a good carrier massage oil is recommended when administering cold stone massage.  Massage oils and lotions can get slightly slimy if they come in contact with the condensation from the cold stones.

What are the benefits of cold stone massage?

Cold stone massage recipients enjoy a variety of benefits.  As previously mentioned, cold stone therapy is ideal for sports injuries because it reduces pain and swelling from the site and accelerates healing.  Cold stones placed on the face (usually over a towel or cloth) help alleviate sinus problems like congestion and swelling as well as reduce under eye bags and dark circles.  Menstrual discomfort like bloating and pain due to cramps is relieved by cold stones.  Clients who suffer from high blood pressure may benefit from cold stone massage therapy as well.  Overall, cold stones improve a person?s mood---lifting depression, decreasing anxiety and generally increasing their overall energy level.

So give cold stone massage therapy a try---either by itself or with hot stone therapy.  It is a fun and helpful way to heal injuries, reduce swelling and inflammation and get an energy boost.

"A Guide to Cold Stone Massage

Why in the world would you use ?cold? stones in massage therapy?!  Brrrrrrrr?.that?s my first thought!

If you have had physical therapy, you may very well have experienced ice massage.  Cold temperatures have their place in healing techniques. Cold stone massage is not as intense as ice, thank goodness; and it does not desensitize the skin as severely as ice does.
Cold Stone MassageThere are many uses and benefits of cold stone massage:

    encourages circulation
    reduces swelling/inflammation
    decrease soreness
    pulls heat from the body
    placed on the face it helps sinusitis
    helps decrease high blood pressure
    eases discomfort associated with hot temperatures/hot flashes
    relaxes muscle spasms
    decreases menstrual pain
    restores energy levels
    helps relieve the pain of migraines

How does cold stone massage cause the body to react as listed above?

When cold stones are placed on the skin, it initially causes narrowing of the blood vessels (vasoconstriction). When they are removed, the blood vessels dilate (vasodilation), bringing fresh blood and oxygen to that area, which increases circulation. Two types of stones are commonly used for cold stone massage: marine sedimentary stones (limestone) and marble, because they retain cold longer than other stones.

When hot stones and cold stones are combined and used alternatingly it increases circulation even more than when either is used alone, as it causes a pumping action. This pumping action (the Hunting Response) helps in the removal of toxins and encourages healing.

Cold stone massage should feel good if it is done properly. The stones should be cold, not cool; depending on where and how they are being used. If a stone is not cold enough it can feel absolutely awful. Move very slowly, this gives the cold stone a chance to penetrate the muscle tissue. You need to make sure that the tissue has been warmed before applying cold. The stones are drawing out excess heat, if there is no excess heat to draw out, it will only cool the area. The whole idea is to ?balance?.

There are marble stone kits that may be purchased with precut stones that are ideal.

I challenge you to try one (or all) of the three techniques for cold stone massage listed below, both receiving one and giving one.  I will look forward to hearing you feedback!

A kit will usually contain at least:

    2 large crescent shaped stones that can be used at the occipital area
    3-7 oblong shaped stones that may used on the forehead
    2 smaller crescent shaped stones that may be placed under eyes
    2 thick round stones for massaging the temple

You will want to place the stones in a bowl of ice water to cool. Have a towel handy to pat dry before placing on client.
Vascular Type Headaches

The large crescents can work wonders to help relieve the pounding of a headache of vascular nature. Place the 2 large crescents at the base of the occiput. Remove after one minute and replace in ice bowl to cool. Use the 2 temple stones in a circular movement on the temple for one minute. Return to the ice water.  Repeat this procedure alternating the crescents and temple stones 2 more times.
Sinus Headaches

Take 3-5 of the oblong shaped stones and place the first on the forehead midway between the eyebrows. Two-four more may be placed on either side of the first along the forehead. Two more may be placed on the cheek bones. Leave on for one minute, remove, replace in ice bowl to cool. Use the 2 temple stones in a circular movement on the temple for one minute. Return to the ice water.  Repeat this procedure alternating the oblong and temple stones 2 more times.
Eye Puffiness

To help relieve eye puffiness place the two small crescents under the eyes. Leave on for one minute, remove, replace in ice bowl to cool. Use the 2 temple stones in a circular movement on the temple for one minute. Return to the ice water.  Repeat this procedure alternating the small crescents and temple stones 2 more times.

"What is Hot & Cold Stone Therapy?

Hot & Cold Stone Therapy treatment will leave you speechless. It utilizes approximately 85 stones in varying temperatures and sizes. The heat from warm basalt stones penetrates deeply to help loosen and sooth tighten congested muscles. The cool marble stones are used to reduce inflammation; creating a balanced and rejuvenating treatment. Eastern and Western techniques are blended into a method of treatment that is nothing less than spectacular in recipient enjoyment and therapeutic results.

The stones are placed along your spine, under your neck, hands, on your face on your chakras, on your feet, between your toes and use to massage your whole body with them from head to toe using luxury oil.

The treatment is finished with gentle stretching and smudging with the sage, which cleans us from negative energy.

At the beginning of a ?Geo Thermo Therapy for Body, Mind and Soul? treatment, the body starts at its normal resting temperature of approximately 98.6.

When the hot stones are applied, information is transmitted to the command center announcing that there is a change in the temperature of the periphery or surface of the skin. It is not a large change, per say, but enough that the blood vessels dilate to allow more blood flow into the area. This creates a slight reddening of the skin or hyperemia. A slight sedation takes place as the brain senses a nice warm relaxed state of being.

When the cold stones are applied, there is a very large difference in temperature. Momentarily, there is a constriction of the blood vessels. The constriction pushes blood and lymph out of the area. The more extreme the temperature is, the stronger the response. Extremes are viewed as a threat to survival. The brain sends out riders to gather all the blood from other areas like kidneys, lungs, heart, liver, etc. to ?warm up? the area being threatened. The body views this situation as a threat causing a mass of blood to be rushed in very quickly. This purge of blood rushes through tissues and organs, warming and cleaning as it passes. Where there is fresh blood, there are fresh nutrients to promote nourishment and healing down to a cellular level. So short-term application of cold actually creates a ?heating? effect. The body?s overall immune system functions more efficiently and is thereby strengthened. If the body is induced to respond to the challenge of maintaining homeostasis, it becomes stronger, having met the challenge and keeping the balance.

Geo thermo therapy is the use of Mother Earth?s stones to transmit the required temperatures and induce the desired physiologic response in the body.

Upon the application of the hot stones, the temperature difference raises from 98.6 degree to 137 degree (the top recommended temperature). The total difference is approximately 38.4 degree (keep in mind that this temperature decreases rapidly as you massage with the stones).

With the application of cold stones, the temperature is lowered from 98.6 degree to 30 degree (the lowest recommended temperature). The total difference with cold stones is 68.6 degree. The body?s command center does not view this 40 degree difference with hot stones as too much of a treat, however, when we apply the cold stones; the body views that as a formidable challenge.","https://www.europeanmedicalmassageco.com/techniques/hot-cold-stone-therapy/","cold stone benefits","google",NA,NA

Benefits of Hot Stone & Cold Stone Therapy

03-02-2013

The benefits of hot stone massage

Hot stone massage is not only a relaxing massage method, but it also has many healing properties. The use of hot stones allows a therapist to give a deep, penetrating massage without putting excessive stress on his or her own body. Additionally, the stones will heat the skin, open the pores, and prepare one's skin to better absorb massage oils. They, therefore, increase the benefits any given oil will provide. The use of massage stones is also a great way to increase circulation in and around the area being massaged. Increased blood flow will help clear out toxins and assist in healing an injured or strained area.
The benefits of cold stone massage

Cold stones are excellent because they promote circulation and act as a powerful decongestant for the body. By promoting circulation, a cold stone treatment can ease inflamed tissues, decrease muscle spasms, and can reduce swelling or fluid build-up (for example, as manifested in dark circles under the eyes). Unlike with the use of ice, cold stone treatments will not severely desensitize the skin. The overall effect of a treatment is the reduction of tension with a simultaneous feeling of invigoration.","https://www.jolispa.com/benefits-of-hot-stone-cold-stone-therapy/","cold stone benefits","google",NA,NA

In addition, massaging and alternating the hot and cool stones helps every cell in the body to receive more oxygen and nutrients and moves lymph thereby encouraging a more effective removal of toxins.

Blood vessels will rise to the surface and dilate when the hot stone is applied and then vessels will constrict and move blood back to the inner core muscles when cold is applied. The opening and closing of the blood vessels causes a pumping action within the circulatory system which brings in more blood to the lungs and heart. It?s pretty much a vascular gymnastics for the body. It allows the body to achieve the same level of relaxation and rejuvenation as going to a sauna and jumping in the plunge pool but with the benefit of a massage included.

The combination of the hot and cold stones are extremely relaxing  and clients often can?t tell the difference between the hot and cold when performed by a skilled therapist.","https://thatsbetter.co.nz/hot-cold-stone-massage-training-nz/benefits-of-hot-cold-stone-massage/","cold stone benefits","google",NA,NA

Cool Down! Do you need a cold stone massage?

You?ve most likely heard of hot stone massage, which helps to relax the muscles. However, heat shouldn?t get all of the attention in the massage therapy world. Cold stone massage is also a valuable treatment to consider. While the basalt stone that is used for a hot stone massage is great for retaining heat, cold stone massage utilizes stones made from marble. Marble stones retain cold temperatures quite well since they are naturally colder than other stones, even at room temperature.

While cold stone massage is most commonly used to treat sports injuries, there are many other positive benefits. This treatment is also used as a form of stress and anxiety relief, as the stones redirect the mind?s focus on the body. The cool temperatures used in the treatment also help to reduce swelling, bloating and inflammation while increasing circulation and boosting energy levels. The cold stones can also ease sinus and menstrual symptoms. Sometimes hot and cold stones are used together using the ?yin and yang? concept. The combination is said to increase circulation while reducing inflammation and pain. A word of caution: individuals who have certain heart ailments or cold sensitivities should avoid cold stone massage until they have discussed it with their physician first.

Cool Off Your Summer with Cold Stone Massage

Give your clients the benefit of stone massage therapy in the summer. Working with cold marble stones can be refreshing and relaxing for both you and your client.

 
Why cold stones?

It is amazing how the body embraces cold from marble. The intense cold of marble stones only lasts about 17 seconds, because marble begins to warm the moment it touches the skin, whereas ice or cold packs tend to stay cold and feel less comfortable. Marble is a very soft stone and has a tendency to absorb heat from tissue, helping ease inflammation and making it ideal for cold stone massage.

 
Stone massage for stress relief

To provide the benefits of stone massage therapy while cooling and relaxing the client, try this technique. (Note: Do not place stones directly on the client?s body?always place a sheet, pillowcase or towel between the stones and the client?s skin.)

    Place cooled, rectangular marble stones on a massage table, reflecting the areas on either side of the spine from the sacrum to the neck.
    Cover the cold stones with a sheet or pillowcase and help the client lie back on the cold stones.
    To neutralize the cold from the marble, place a hot stone on the client?s abdomen.
    Next, place a cold stone on the solar plexus, followed by a warm stone on the heart chakra.
    Continue the treatment by alternating hot and cold stones on various body locations. This cold-and-hot technique causes the constriction and dilation of blood vessels, which is both relaxing and stimulating. I call it vascular gymnastics.
    As the client lies with the stones in place, manually massage her face, head and feet.
    Remove all stones and ask the client to turn over.
    Place one large, warm stone on the sacrum, then place cold stones in the client?s hands and warm stones between her fingers.
    Apply massage oil and massage the client?s back with warm stones, then cold stones, then warm and cold at the same time.

 
Benefits of stone massage

At the completion of this stone massage treatment, clients may feel like they have just had a long nap and are ready to tackle the rest of their day. This is a wonderful session for a client who comes in at lunchtime and will go back to work, or needs to relax before an important meeting.

This treatment also gives the therapist the opportunity to provide stone massage when the weather is hot. Clients who normally feel hot find the addition of cold marble stones to massage to be a delight.","https://www.massagemag.com/cool-off-your-summer-with-cold-stone-massage-31510/","cold stone benefits","google",NA,NA

Does full body massage include private parts?

Does full body massage include private parts?	

NO. A full thai body massage doesnt include private parts massage. If it does then thats not a massage or you are at the wrong place. But who cares?

Now there is a difference of opinion as to whether private parts should be included or not. Lets see the reasons.
Private parts massage: Is it a Taboo!

Full body massage means head to toe including everything. Not only private parts but a full body massage includes your hair, head, eyes, ears, and chin. Although its a total body massage from top to bottom still you will be kicked out of the massage room before time.

I got a complete top to a bottom massage once in a spa at Ghod Dod Road. The girl was remarkably a trained and professional massage therapist. Her hands were soft on my body and she really did a very good massage.

In fact, I was surprised to see that after back, front, leg, shoulders she was giving me a head massage. That was something out of the box. I wont forget it. It was so relaxing that I fell into a deep sleep.

Lets see what the internet thinks about private parts massage.
Quora on private parts massage

    According to Julia Wilson, Certified Massage Therapist

    As some have pointed out, different cultures and different countries have different regulations on such things and different taboos on that style of massage. This is true. However, in the U.S. it is unethical and illegal for a massage therapist to work on a clients private parts (aka genitals).

    If a massage therapist in the U.S. offers to give a massage of the genitals in any other case, then they are either ignoring the laws and ethical regulations of their profession, or they are not a licensed massage therapist at all.

The new york post on private parts massage

    From deep tissue to hot stone, there isnt much the massage industry has not offered. But the latest craze is for the most intimate treatment yet. The yoni massage is exclusively for women and focuses on a ladys private parts.

    But the treatment comes at a price  an hour-long session can cost up to 250 ($330). Heres what happened when Nilufer Atik put her inhibitions aside to give the yoni massage a try:

    Name a type of massage and the chances are Ive tried it. For me, theres nothing better than lying semi-comatose on a kitten-soft bed while a stranger pummels the giant knots from my back.

What is never OK during a massage? by SheKnows

    If you are getting a massage for therapeutic or relaxing purposes, it is never acceptable for the therapist to touch the clients genitals. That area is strictly off-limits.

    In most cases, a womans breast tissue is also avoided during a massage. There is one exception to this, though: Getting a breast massage after a mastectomy.

    But according to Agakian, before getting this type of treatment, the client needs a referral from a doctor and should ensure they are working with a therapist who has been trained in this specific type of massage.

    Hunter also notes that whether its legal to involve breasts in a massage can depend on the state, but even in places where its acceptable, it still may require written consent from the client.

Moral of the story

You might feel weird but here in Surat, most massage centers provide private part massage services. And this comes straight from a professional massage therapist.

Even in the top and premium luxury spas, the massage therapist asks for extra money giving extra services to rich clients. Thats the reality everywhere.

He laughs and tells me he has some ""acquaintances"" that go there and that it's definitely a Happy Ending type place.  He then goes on to tell me how he's been on the receiving end of a Happy Ending at one of those types of places.  It didn't really surprise me because his wife is borderline crazy.

    Suicidal thoughts
    Seizures

When to go to an Urgent Care Clinic

When you have a problem, do not wait too long to get medical care. If your problem is not life threatening or risking disability, but you are concerned and you cannot see your provider soon enough, go to an urgent care clinic.

The kinds of problems an urgent care clinic can deal with include:

    Common illnesses, such as colds, the flu, earaches, sore throats, migraines, low-grade fevers, and limited rashes
    Minor injuries, such as sprains, back pain, minor cuts and burns, minor broken bones, or minor eye injuries

If you are not Sure, Talk to Someone

If you are not sure what to do, and you don't have one of the serious conditions listed above, call your provider. If the office is not open, your phone call may be forwarded to someone. Describe your symptoms to the provider who answers your call, and find out what you should do.

Your provider or health insurance company may also offer a nurse telephone advice hotline. Call this number and tell the nurse your symptoms for advice on what to do.

"General guidelines - When to visit an emergency room

Call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately when someone experiences any of the following:

    wheezing, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
    chest pain
    displaced or open wound fractures
    fainting or dizziness
    sudden numbness or weakness
    bleeding that cannot be stopped
    abdominal pain - especially intense localized pain
    fever with convulsions or any fever in children under 3 months
    confusion or changes in mental status
    coughing or vomiting blood
    severe headache or head injury, especially if the individual is on aspirin or blood thinners
    blood in the urine, or bloody diarrhea
    sudden inability to speak, see, walk or move

The symptoms above are not a complete, specific listing, but rather guidelines. In addition, people should also consider the number of symptoms. Several symptoms that seem minor may be significant when they occur at the same time. If a situation arises, and you arent certain whether or not a visit to an emergency room is necessary, head to the emergency room for an evaluation.
When to visit an after-hours clinic or urgent care facility

If the individuals symptoms do not meet these guidelines and you believe they do not require a trip to the emergency room, a call to his or her primary care physicians office is a good first step. The primary care physician will be able to advise on the individual situation.

If you need to be seen during the evening or on a weekend, consider going to an after-hours clinic or urgent care facility. These may be appropriate options for:

    cough, cold or sore throat
    rashes or skin irritations
    fever or flu-like symptoms
    mild injuries
    earaches

Plan ahead to make the right choice

Think ahead and familiarize yourself with these guidelines to prepare for a potential emergency situation. Think about which emergency room you would prefer for your family and plan the fastest route to get there safely.","https://www.beaumont.org/health-wellness/blogs/should-you-go-to-the-er-dont-downplay-potentially-serious-symptoms","ER","google",NA,NA

How to know where to go for sudden health care needs
The difference between urgent care and emergency care and where is best to seek treatment.

All too often, illness or injury appears out of the blue: You wake up in the middle of the night with intense abdominal pain. You stumble while carrying groceries up a flight of stairs, and can no longer put weight on your swollen ankle. Or your baby spikes a high fever on the weekend.


When these situations occur, were often faced with uncertainty about where to go for care, especially if the symptoms seem severe and our regular doctors office is closed.


While the answer is not always simple, knowing the difference between walk-in clinics, urgent care and emergency care and where to seek treatment could save your life in a medical emergency.


    When to go to the ER
    When to call 911
    When to go to urgent care
    When to go to a walk-in clinic
    How to be prepared

The differences between walk-in clinics, urgent care and the emergency room

Recognizing the differences between emergency and urgent care can be confusing, because both terms imply there is a medical need that needs to be addressed quickly, says Shawn Evans, MD, an emergency medicine physician at Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla. However, there are distinct differences between hospital emergency rooms, traditional urgent care centers or walk-in clinics, including the level of care that can be provided at each.


Urgent care or walk-in clinics help fill a vital gap when you become sick or injured, but your regular doctor is not available and you cant wait for an appointment.


If your sudden illness or injury is something you would normally feel comfortable addressing with your primary care doctor, then an urgent care center or walk-in clinic setting is probably more appropriate than the emergency room, says Dr. Evans.


Hospital emergency departments provide medical care at any time, day or night. However, unlike urgent care centers or walk-in clinics, they are equipped and staffed for even the most complex or critical needs, including life- and limb-threatening situations ranging from heart attack and stroke to traumatic injuries following a car accident.
When to go to the ER

There are a number of medical conditions that are considered emergencies because they can require rapid or advanced treatments (such as surgery) that are only available in a hospital setting.


Symptoms that are best evaluated in an emergency room include:


    Chest pain or difficulty breathing
    Weakness/numbness on one side
    Slurred speech
    Fainting/change in mental state
    Serious burns
    Head or eye injury
    Concussion/confusion
    Broken bones and dislocated joints
    Fever with a rash
    Seizures
    Severe cuts that may require stitches
    Facial lacerations
    Severe cold or flu symptoms
    Vaginal bleeding with pregnancy


Trust your gut, says Dr. Evans. If your personal instinct or your motherly intuition tells you its serious, dont hesitate  go to the nearest emergency room.


Scripps emergency rooms are located in Encinitas, La Jolla (inside Prebys), San Diego (in Hillcrest) and Chula Vista.
When to call 911

Even if it is clear that you or your loved one needs emergency care, you may be unsure whether to drive yourself to an emergency room or call 911.


Many people are nervous about calling 911, but its better to be safe than sorry, says Dr. Evans. You should never drive yourself if you are having severe chest pain or severe bleeding, if you feel like you might faint or if your vision is impaired. When in doubt, please call 911  what matters most is that you get to the emergency room quickly and safely.


For certain medical emergencies such as a heart attack or stroke, calling 911 for an ambulance is always the right decision. This is because paramedics often can begin delivering life-saving treatment on the way to the hospital.
When to go to urgent care

Urgent care is not emergency care. A study conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics found that among patients who had visited the emergency room but were not admitted to the hospital, 48 percent went there because their doctors office was not open.


Many people use the ER as a place to receive after-hours care for minor illnesses or injuries without realizing they have another option, says Dr. Evans.


Urgent care centers are same-day clinics that can handle a variety of medical problems that need to be treated right away, but are not considered true emergencies. Symptoms that can be evaluated and treated at an urgent care clinic include:


    Fever without a rash
    Vomiting or persistent diarrhea
    Abdominal pain
    Wheezing or shortness of breath
    Dehydration
    Moderate flu-like symptoms
    Sprains and strains
    Small cuts that may require stitches


If your symptoms come on gradually or you already know the diagnosis  for example, you have repeat urinary tract infections, or you recognize when your child has come down with an ear infection  its worth calling your primary care doctors office to see if you can get a same-day appointment. After all, your primary care doctor knows your health history, including what treatments have worked best in the past and whether you have other medical conditions that need to be taken into consideration.


However, while urgent care clinics are not a substitute for your primary care physician, they are a great resource when you need care but cant get in with your doctor.


Scripps offers urgent care services for children and adults  seven days a week  in Vista, Rancho Bernardo and Torrey Pines.
When to go to a walk-in clinic

Walk-in clinics (commonly referred to as a retail clinic) offer fast, convenient access to medical care. No appointment is necessary and they are generally staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants. 


Walk-in clinics, including Scripps HealthExpress, address the most minor of ailments, such as:


    Painful urination
    Rashes without fever
    Mild flu-like symptoms
    Cough and congestion symptoms
    Sore throat
    Ear pain
    Eye redness, discharge or itchiness


They also provide additional services, such as sports physical and vaccines. They are a good option for when you are not feeling well, but its not serious enough for the emergency room or urgent care.","https://www.scripps.org/news_items/4231-should-you-go-to-the-emergency-room-or-urgent-care","ER","google",NA,NA
"How to Know If You Need to Go to the E.R. With Coronavirus
Sometimes staying home is the right call.

By Colleen Stinchcombe
How to Know If You Need to Go to the E.R. With Coronavirus
Getty / Studio 642 / Hiraman; Designed by Morgan Johnson

The new coronavirus is pretty much all any of us are hearing about right now, and its no wonder why. Cities and states across the country have shut down bars and restaurants, canceled events, and askedor requiredresidents to stay home. Schools have closed their doors all over the nation. In major cities like Seattle (where I live), San Francisco, and New York, rush hour traffic has taken a nosedive due to people working from home or, unfortunately, losing their jobs because its not safe for them to be at work right now and impossible to do their work remotely.

All of this is being done in an effort to flatten the curve, or to slow both the speed of infection and the number of people who become infected with the new coronavirus disease (also known as COVID-19) so that hospitals have enough equipment and space for critically ill people. Medical workers need to focus their energy on the sickest patients, and theyre already starting to feel the crunch.

The Seattle Times reported that the University of Washington Medical Center was understaffed and exceptionally full, and that medical supplies have run low. Jessica P.,* a registered nurse with an emergency room specialty south of Seattle, tells SELF that nurses in her hospital have been asked to reuse surgical masks all day (paired with face shields), even though they would typically throw masks away after each patientand that their hospital is out of N95 respirators.

Jessica also says that it is taking some time for people on the front lines of patient care to learn that someone theyre treating tested positive for the new coronavirus. This has translated into waiting days before knowing definitively whether or not theyve interacted with a person with a confirmed case of COVID-19. Thats what weve really been struggling withnot enough protection for the nurses, Jessica tells SELF, and not feeling safe to do our jobs because we dont have what we need to do our [jobs].

Clearly, keeping our hospitals below capacity and our doctors, nurses, and other care providers healthy is critical. That will take everyones cooperation, including, as surprising as it sounds, many people who either know they have the new coronavirus or think that they might. If youre in that situation, its essential to know the difference between when you can manage your symptoms at home in self-quarantinethus freeing up medical care for someone with a more severe caseand when you need to seek emergency attention yourself.
If your symptoms are mild, please stay home.

Lets say youve got mild symptoms that are consistent with the new coronavirus, the most common being a cough, fever, and some shortness of breath. As counterintuitiveand hardas this sounds, dont immediately go to the emergency room.

You dont need to go to the hospital just because you think you have the virus, Louise Catherine Ivers, M.D., M.P.H., infectious disease and public health doctor, director of the Center for Global Health at Massachusetts General Hospital, and associate professor at Harvard Medical School, tells SELF.

We can understand the urge to seek IRL care immediately in this really scary situation, but there are a few reasons why its better to stay home if you seem to have a mild case. For one, testing is still limited in many places, and its unclear how quickly tests will become widely available. When health facilities do have tests, they typically have to prioritize testing people with more severe symptoms because there just arent enough tests to go around right now, as SELF previously reported. Also, there arent currently any antiviral treatments designed for the new coronavirus (like there are for the flu). That means theres no special new coronavirus drug regimen you can only access with a confirmed diagnosis. Instead, the current medical guidance for suspected and confirmed mild COVID-19 cases is to manage your symptoms at home. Finally, staying at home with a mild case can help our hospitals and intensive care units stay within their capacity as much as possible.

This doesnt mean you shouldnt get in touch with a doctor at all. Even if your symptoms are mild, you should still notify your primary care doctor if you can so you can get their advice. This is especially true for people with underlying illnesses that are known to create a higher risk of new coronavirus complications, such as heart disease, diabetes, and asthma, Dr. Ivers says, and people 60 and over who are also more vulnerable to complications.

Watch out for [a] 100.4 temperature [as] an indicator of when you should start making calls and ensure that you are isolated from others. A thermometer is a good tool during this pandemic, Brandon Brown, M.P.H., Ph.D., an epidemiologist and associate professor in the Department of Social Medicine, Population, and Public Health at the University of California, Riverside, tells SELF.

Your doctor can advise you on whether youre a candidate for testing and where testing might be available in your area. They may have even set up a specific hotline for new coronavirus concerns, which can be a good starting place. Otherwise, check your local department of healths online resources. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) are good resources for national and international information, but when it comes to handling your own potential or confirmed new coronavirus case, experts typically agree that local information has a lot of advantages.

Your own state will have a public health website, like the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Thats going to give more specific information, Dr. Ivers says. (Your state might even have set up a dedicated new coronavirus hotline as well.)

Beyond that, take care of yourself and follow guidance from your doctor and resources like the CDC. Overall, youll need to do things like isolating yourself in your home and from other people who live with you as best you can, washing your hands frequently, and wearing a mask when youre around other people. (Since masks are in such short supply right now, you might have to ask medical personnel or a nearby health center for help getting one.) Heres more information about taking care of yourself at home if you have mild new coronavirus symptoms.

Also, for the sake of your mental health, try not to panic, as hard as that is right now. We do know that most people who get the infection do just fine, Dr. Ivers says. We want to make sure that we have enough capacity to take care of the people who dont do fine.
If your symptoms get noticeably worse, it might be time for emergency care.

The reason to go to the emergency room hasnt really changed, Allison Bond, M.D., infectious disease fellow at UC San Francisco, tells SELF. If youre having severe symptoms, its critical that you seek out care or ask the person whos looking after you to help you get medical care immediately.

The CDC suggests that immediate medical attention is necessary if you think or know you have the new coronavirus and are experiencing:

    Difficulty breathing
    Persistent chest pain or pressure
    Confusion that you werent experiencing before
    An inability to get up
    A blue tint to your lips or face

There are a lot of caveats when it comes to applying this type of list to real life. For example, difficulty breathing is on the above list, but what exactly does that mean when shortness of breath is one hallmark sign of the new coronavirus to begin with? People who cant catch their breath should go to the E.R., Dr. Bond says. Everyone else with less severe breathing symptoms should call their doctor. Also, the CDC notes that this isnt a complete list, and if you have other concerning symptoms, you should contact your doctor. For example, if youre vomiting and/or have diarrhea, are unable to keep down food or water, and youre starting to feel lightheaded or weak, that may indicate its time to seek medical attention, just as you might if there werent a pandemic. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting are not associated with coronavirus very often, but they do occur, Dr. Bond says. If youre not sure what youre dealing with is concerning enough that you need to leave to go to the emergency room, thats when it can be especially helpful to call your doctor, a new coronavirus hotline in your state if one is available, or even the emergency room itself to discuss your symptoms.
Try to call ahead before going to the emergency room.

Of course, the first priority in any emergency is to make sure youre contacting 911 or heading to the E.R., especially if youre alone and dont have anyone to help you. But if at all possible, experts recommend that people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 do two things before going into the emergency room with worsening symptoms: Put on a mask and call the emergency room before you arrive.

If youre not able to call ahead, Dr. Bond recommends that you do your best to keep your distanceat least six feetfrom other people while on your way in, and as soon as you arrive, alert the people at the registration desk (or the emergency workers who come to get you in an ambulance) to the fact that you either might or definitely do have the new coronavirus. The sooner any emergency workers know whats going on, the sooner they can try to get you the care you may need.","https://www.self.com/story/coronavirus-er-signs","ER","google",NA,NA
